t.m.k. Keyboard Firmware
========================
http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard

This is keyboard firmware for PFU HHKB style keyboard and Teensy/Teensy++ 2.0.
OS see this as composite device which has keyboard and mouse.

The project is heavily based on PJRC USB Keyboard/Mouse Example and
owes a debt to preceding keyboard firmware projects.


Version
-------
0.1     2010/08/23
        It works as normal keyboard.
        It is for modified Macway keyboard(TP-999KB-E).

1.0     2010/10/02
        keyboard has mouse key now.
        keyboard with layers.(see keymap.c)
            FN_1(right cmd):
                vi style layer
            FN_2(next to right shift):
                HHKB style layer
            FN_3(left bottom):

1.1     2010/10/08
        Matrix wiring changed for casing.
        (and my Teensy PD3 seems to be latchuped and unusable. :<)

1.2     2010/10/13
        HHKB support
        horizontal mouse wheel support
        change keymaps

2.0     2010/10/27
        HHKB/Macway support merged


Build
-----
Compiling sources need AVR GCC, AVR Libc and GNU make.(You can use WinAVR on Windows.)

$ cd <target> (hhkb or macway)
$ make


Debuging
--------
Debug print is on if 4 keys are pressed during booting. 
Use PJRC's hid_listen.exe to see debug messages.

TODO & ideas
------------
licensing notes(GPL)
    I think GPL is not infringement of PJRC license.
souce code cleaning
sleep&wakeup
debouncing logic
    will be coded when bouncing occurs.
    bouncing doesnt occur on my ALPS switch so far.
    scan rate is too slow?(to be measure)

Trackpoint(PS/2)
    receive PS/2 signal from TrackPoint
    send USB HID report
Thinkpad keyboard support
    turn keyboard to USB keyboard/mouse composite device
setting menu(configure without changing firmware)
    console for display
    keymap/layer setting
    mouse speed/acceleration
    matrix display
PS/2 keyboard mode
    with USB to PS/2 dumb adapter(possible?)
AT90USBKEY support
    and other AVR USB boards

DONE:
support for HHKB pro matrix signal
    exchange controller board with teensy
