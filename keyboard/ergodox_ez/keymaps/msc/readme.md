# MSC Configuration

### Based mostly on the ErgoDox EZ default layout with optimizations for coding on osx.

#### Focused on moving heavily used keys for coding JavaScript or any bracketed languages into prime locations. The 'esc' key's lcoation is place under the right thumb for VIM users. This allows a quick toggle back to NORMAL mode.
