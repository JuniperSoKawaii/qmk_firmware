# Filco Majestouch 2 TKL RP 2040 mod

Controller replacement for Filco Majestouch 2 TKL (ISO) by Blaskkaffe

This is based around rp2040 but will need 28 gpio pins so it will not work with Raspberry Pi pico, you will have to use a clone.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make blaskkaffe/majestouch2040:default

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
