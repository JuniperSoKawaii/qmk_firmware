# Crkbd

Using a no 6th column crkbd (rev 2.1 choc) as a mobile keyboard.

This version uses Elite-C and ProMicro as controllers; hence no RGB and OLED.

## Build

Build command: `CFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated" TBF`

## Todo

* Switch PCB to the Proton-C compatible hotswap switch.
* Or use cable rerouting to make the pcb Proton-C compatible.
* Or find a way to use both OLED and LEDs.
