# Twey's Home Configuration
## Layers
- Layer 0: Non-ANSI Dvorak layout, with modified modifiers — all
  modifiers on thumb keys, as well as return and space.
- Layer 1: Default symbol layout.
- Layer 2: Plover-oriented stenography layer.
- Layer 3: Extended media/mouse layout.

## Unusual features
The Plover key (top right key on the left half in media mode) also
sends the default Plover ‘toggle’ chord (`PHROLG`, defined in
`commands.json`) when pressed, as well as toggling the steno layer, so
you can toggle between steno and typing modes with a single keypress.

## Hardware notes
The default Ergodox EZ keycaps are delightfully staggered, which seems
like it would make them terrible for steno, but in fact flipping the
top row (`QWERTYUIOP`) and the middle thumb keys upside down brings
them close enough together to give a rather pleasant steno experience,
without interfering much with standard Dvorak typing.
