# Planck

I use a couple [planck](../../../../keyboards/planck/readme.md) keyboards.
To sell soon; don't use them anymore.

* Use the [light](../../../../keyboards/planck/light/readme.md) version.
* Use the [rev6](../../../../keyboards/planck/rev6/readme.md) version.

I have a daughter board that I'm trying to use for perkey leds.
Originally, in the firmware, the underglow rgb prints are configured both for
`RGBLIGHT` and `RGBMATRIX` code.
I differentiate between these two; and use;

* `RGBLIGHT` for underglow leds.
* `RGB_MATRIX` for the daughterboard, if I get to it at some point. (Doubtful)

Enable in rules.mk accordingly.

# JJ40

A planck rev4 replacement; for my acrylic planck case which used to host a now
defunct rev4.

Enable in rules.mk accordingly.

## Status

* [x] Layout adapted
* [ ] Have not tested build yet.
* [ ] Have not confirmed on board

# Let's Split Eh?

I have a [let's split eh?](../../../../keyboards/lets_split_eh/README.md), unused, will sell this.
