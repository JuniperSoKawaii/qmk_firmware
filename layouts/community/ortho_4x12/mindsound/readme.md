# Josh's 4x12 layout

Notable features:

* Esc and Del are in the lower left
* Left space is `MOD_HYPER` on hold
* Backspace is still backspace on `RAISE` and `LOWER`
* Faux clicky controls are on the arrow keys on the `ADJUST` layer, and the backlight controls are directly above that
* Colemak and other layouts are thoroughly disabled
