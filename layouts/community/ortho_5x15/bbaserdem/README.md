# XD75RE

One of my first boards, the [XD75Re](../../../../keyboards/xd75/readme.md).
(At least before the price hike.)
To be sold.

The board has `RGBLIGHT_ENABLE` leds underneath; but I use a wooden case.
Instead; I hooked up some LED's to the three lock indicators.
I use them for layer indication.
