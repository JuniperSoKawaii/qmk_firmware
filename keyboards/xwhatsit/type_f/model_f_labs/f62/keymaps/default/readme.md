# A keymap for xwhatsit/model_f_labs/f62/$(CONTROLLER)

This is a synthetic keymap using the LAYOUT_all macro. No keyboards are shipped with access to all of the sensing pads at once, but this may be a good starting-point for modded keyboards.
Please make sure that you set inexistent keys to KC_NO!
