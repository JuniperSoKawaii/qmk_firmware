# chemicalwill keymap for bear_face

Similar to the default layout with some changes:

- Pn key is set to 'KC_NO'
    * I use it for macros
- Caps Lock indicator LED enabled
- Layer Tap on Caps Lock (tap for Caps Lock, hold for _FN1)
- Sublegends on the stock keycaps are on _FN1
    * 'Reset' will put the keyboard into DFU
    * 'APP' sends 'KC_APP'

- _FN1 has arrow keys on IJKL
- Media keys are also on Tap Dances (tap for media key, hold for F-row)
