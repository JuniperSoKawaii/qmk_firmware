Större is an easy to build 75%ish keyboard using only through hole components. It uses a separate microcontroller (like the Pro Micro or Elite C) to enable flexibility in connectivity and to further simplify the soldering experience (no more tricksy USB ports).

* Hardware Supported: större, Pro Micro, Elite-C, Puchi-C, Nice!Nano and more...
* Hardware Availability: [sthlm kb](https://sthlmkb.com)
