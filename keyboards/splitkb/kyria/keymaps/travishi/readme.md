## Introduction
This keyboard layout centers around Dvorak,  harnesing the power of the Kyria thumb
clusters and layers to reduce finger movement.
Qwerty is present so you don't have to remap games and any other programs you use.


## Guiding ideology
- Use thumb keys as much as possible
- Minimise home row departure
- Minimize or eliminate non home row pinkie finger use
- Create macros for very common key shortcuts (ctrl + c/v/s, ctrl+shift+home etc.)
- Create macros for very common commands (git status, git pull, git push etc.)

- Use hints to indicate current layer (rgb lighting/OLED display)
- Allow graceful layer handling (emergency return to default layer/layer index layer)


## Current Layers
Base1: dvorak
Base2: qwerty

## Future Layers
Layer_1: navigation & keypad
Layer_2: F keys
Layer_3: FE macros
Layer_4: Git macros


## Issues
### Major so far
- [ ] Arrows / navs missing
- [ ] Symbols and numbers missing
- [ ] Function keys missing (NUM CAPS SCROLL)
- [ ] Media functions missing

### Minor
- [ ] Backlight LEDs dont indicate layer
- [ ] OLEDs not showing overly useful info (Especially the right OLED)
- [ ] Not fully using thumb clusters
