A11 and 
A12 are USB; 
A9 has an undocumented pulldown resistor inside the chip; 
B2 is BOOT1 and has a 10k pulldown on the blackpill board (pulling this pin high will prevent entering DFU)
C13 has a LED with resistor towards 3.3V â€” technically it is still usable for the matrix, but the LED will light up
C14 and 
C15 have the 32786 Hz crystal attached (this won't prevent using them for the matrix, but maybe you wanted to attach a battery and make RTC work, like on Satisfaction75 :wink: )

A4, A5, A6, A7 to install an SPI EEPROM chip on the back of blackpill
