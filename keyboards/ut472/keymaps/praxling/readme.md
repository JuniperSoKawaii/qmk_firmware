# praxling's modified layout

This has a single alpha layout for Dvorak, with the locations of the semicolon and single quote swapped to match the modified Programmer Dvorak layout (http://programmer-dvorak.appspot.com/)

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make ut472:praxling-dvorak
