I wrote this stuff a few years ago and mechmerlin found it, made some changes and did a pull request.
This board was not in QMK, but it was configured with QMK and referenced some google web site to configure, that software sucked for a beginner(me).
I have a bit of electronics knowledge, I reverse out the board and configured QMK. Feels sort of weird claiming copyright on fill in the blanks.
This PCB can nologer be bought. I bought a YD60MQ and hope to do some contributions on it. I though this could be an example of my work.

-- KC60SE --

No push button reset. It has a reset pad on the 6 pin ISP header.

Changes
  Style: 
    remove a bunch of comments
    all files conform to style guidelines
    cformat
    

  rules.mk:
    BOOTMAGIC_ENABLE = lite # esc
    NKRO_ENABLE = yes       # NKRO works
    BACKLIGHT_ENABLE = yes  # backlights not on a hw pwm pin, backlight works, but compile throws warning, changing to 'software' only does on/off,no levels
    MOUSEKEY_ENABLE  = no   # none of the current keymaps have mouse map, disable
    CONSOLE_ENABLE = no     # docs suggest that these be off,
    COMMAND_ENABLE = no     # these were on, but IS_COMMAND() was not defined, so it did not work

  config.h:
    #define FORCE_NKRO      # NKRO default
    #define IS_COMMAND()    # defined in case user enables
    #define MANUFACTURER    # remove NPKC as manufacturer, I remember making an educated guess on who made this board

  kc60se.h:
     remove caps_led inline functions

  kc60se.c:
     remove extern inline caps_led declarations and function
     add cap_led on/off function (all in one stanza, instead of 2 files and 5 stanza)

  info.json:
     all, 60_ansi and 60_ansi_split_bs_rshift have layouts, created using KLE and QMK converter

  kemaps/default/:
    config.h    # removed, empty file
    keymap.c    # T as KC_TOGG, on function layer, style and formating

  Issues:
    When 6KRO, can enter console/command using IS_COMMAND(c), 
    IS_COMMAND(n) switches to NKRO;
    in NKRO mode, all IS_COMMAND() will not work, can't get back to 6KRO, without using bootmagic.

  solution:
    BOOTMAGIC_ENABLE = lite   # to enter bootloader and reduce user exposure to possible bootmagic issues
    #define FORCE_NKRO        # default to NKRO
    NK_TOGGLE in keymap       # toggles NKRO <=> 6KRO, enabling 6KRO when needed;
    bootmagic lite and nk_toggle allows disabling of COMMAND/CONSOLE, which still does not work when in NKRO mode
