# Alper's Contra Layout

I based this off the default and changed some stuff because I'm a macOS user who types in Dvorak:

* Added RSHIFT and RGUI buttons because I use those a lot.
* Changed some left keys to Mod Tap to have more functions
* Added dedicated buttons for app switch and tab left/right

TODO

* Remove Plover layer
* Port changes in Dvorak to the other keyboards for consistency
* Try out tapdance for brackets (see ryanm101/keymap.c)
* REMAP ESC To LT() so I can use it to select numbers (_NUMB) and functions more easily? (see msiu/keymap.c)
