# redoral's custom VIA compatible keymap for Sofle

Based on the `via` keymap and modified it to my own keymap and OLED display preference.

### Features:

-   Qwerty base, custom MO(1) layer tailored to my own preference
-   All transparent MO(2) and MO(3) layers (to start from scratch)
-   The OLED on master half shows selected layer and caps lock state and is rotated, also my name because I didn't know what else to put on there. I suggest updating that string to whatever you like
-   The OLED on the other half shows a ToTK logo from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/15v1o4b/made_a_totk_pic_for_my_oled/).
-   Mouse keys support, MO(1) layer by default has mouse key bindings on offhand board
-   VIA support
-   Added 1000 hz definition because I am not sure if that is default
