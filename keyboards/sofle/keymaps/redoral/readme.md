# redoral's custom VIA compatible keymap for Sofle

Based on the `via` keymap and modified it to my own keymap and OLED display preference.

### Features:

-   Qwerty base, custom MO(1) layer tailored to my own preference
-   All transparent MO(2) and MO(3) layers (to start from scratch)
-   The OLED on master half shows selected layer and caps lock state and is rotated, also my name because I didn't know what else to put on there. I suggest updating that string to whatever you like
-   The OLED on the other half shows a [ToTK logo from u/cassolab](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/15v1o4b/made_a_totk_pic_for_my_oled/)
-   Mouse keys support, MO(1) layer by default has mouse key bindings on offhand board
-   RGB support
-   VIA support

## Default keymaps

This is what I found to be comfortable and fun for my use-case. I do software engineering and this layout works well for me. Since this firmware supports VIA, all of these can be edited via the [web app](https://usevia.app/).

### Base

QWERTY layout with a few modifications. Button between `=` and `\` is blank but I use a macro that I set with VIA.

### MO(1)

Arrow, navigation, mouse, and bracket keys.

### MO(2) and MO(3)

Blank layers. I personally have no use for these layers so all keys are transparent by default so you can start with a clean slate if you do want to use these layers.
