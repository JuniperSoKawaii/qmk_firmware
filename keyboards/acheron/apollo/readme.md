The Apollo is Acheron Project's family of open-source, freely available tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) which main feature is the per-key RGB lighting.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Gondolindrim](https://github.com/Gondolindrim)
* Hardware Supported: open-source PCB using the [Joker template](https://acheronproject.com/joker_mcus/joker/). First units were manufactured using STM32F401 microcontroller;
* Hardware Availability: these PCBs are open-source so you can manufacture them yourself or order them from a factory. See the [project's documentation](https://acheronproject.com/pcbs/apollo/apollo/) for more information.

As of april 7, 2022, Apollo comes in three different layouts:

- 87H (default ANSI)
- 87H-T-SC (ANSI with tsangan bottom row and stepped caps);
- 88H-T-SC (ANSI with F13, tsangan bottom row and stepped caps);

See each variant's README for more information on flashing.
