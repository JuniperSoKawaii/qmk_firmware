# Default keymap for m122-3270
This keymap is intended to make the PC/3270 122-key IBM keyboard work as closely as possible to the standard
PC/3270 keyboard's original mapping. Two layers are defined: layer 0 is the PC layout, using the blue legends
on the PC/3270 keys (as shipped by Unicomp; I don't have the original keycaps, and I know there are a few
differences), while layer 1 is the 3270 layout, with keycodes selected to make the x3270 suite do the right
thing with each key as pressed. The idea here is, eventually, to get x3270 and friends to automatically
shift the keyboard to layer 1 when they gain focus.
