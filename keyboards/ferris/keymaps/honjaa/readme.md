A usable default keymap for the Ferris keyboard
===============================================

Keymaps in general are quite personal, so it is difficult to come up with a default that will suit every user.

This keymap makes heavy use of keys behaving differently when tapped and held, so that all the keys one may need remain accessible despite the low number of thumb keys.

It comes with a number of layers to give access to most of the keys one may need on a keyboard. It is not meant to be the best possible keymap, but rather a good base on which to build a keymap that works for you.

This is not the only way to make 34 keys a comfortable typing experience, but it is one way to do so. If you don't already know of a better way, this may be as good a starting point as any :)

What do all these layers do?
----------------------------

### Layer 0: Base layer

On tapping the keys, our base layer is qwerty with space on the right homing thumb and backspace on the left homing thumb.

In this layer, the non-homing-thumb positions swicht temporarly to layer 1 Left hand modifiers and Numbers (left) and layer 2 Right hand modifiers and Symbols (right)

Combos
enter = j+h
esc = d+f
del = s+d
shift = f+r and j+u
ctrl = d+e and k+i
flash = q+p


### Layer 1: Left Modifiers and Numbers

Layer 1 is has one shot home row modifers on the left hand and numpad on the right
The top row on the left hand are function keys F1-5 F11 is where B is on the base leve and tab on g.

Letting go of the left non-homing thumb key will take you back to the base layer.

### Layer 2: Right modifers and Symbols

Layer 2 has one shot home row modifers on the right hand and symbols on the left
The top row on the right hand are function keys F6-10 F12 is where n is on the base level

Letting go of the right non-homing thumb key will take you back to the base layer.

### Layer 3: Navigation 

Tapping the left non-homing-thumb then the right will take to to the navigation layer
jkl√∏ works as in navigation in vim only moved one key to the right to get it on the home keys
uiop there is home, page down, page up, end
There are emacs macros on the left hand q quit , s save , f timestamp, d line

Tapping the left non-homing thumb key will bring you back to the base layer.

### Layer 4: Mouse 

Tapping the right non-homing-thumb then the left will take to to the mouse layer
sdfe moves the cursor
jkl are left, middle and right mouse keys
uio are up arrow, mouse scroll up and page up
m,. are down arrow, mouse scroll down and page down
h is play / pause toggle
y is media player forward and n is media player back
