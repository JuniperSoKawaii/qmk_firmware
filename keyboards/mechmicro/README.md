The MechMicro is a variant of the MechMini. It does not support an ortho layout, but does have some more options in the staggered layout. It uses a pro micro as the controller.

this will be compatible with QMK.

/u/Lbibass is currently the keyboard maintainer.  

NOTE: CURRENTLY THE FIRST BATCH OF PCBS HAS AN ERROR WHERE THE LAST ROW IS CONNECTED TO GROUND. Be sure to cut this trace, and connect those pins to pin A3 on the Pro Micro. YHN column should be connected to A2, and the OL> should be connected to pin A1. Do note that this is only for the first revision of the PCB. later revisions should not have this problem.
