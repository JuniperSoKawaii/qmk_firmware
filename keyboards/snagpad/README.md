# Snagpad
QMK for Snagpad

This PCB can be used as a standard numpad, or a ortho 5x4 macropad.

Two KBFirmware ONLY.json files to support the two layout options, combination layout you will need to create it yourself.
-Snagpad_ortho.json
-Snagpad_numpad.json

For QMK Configurator, the info.json is utilised.
- For 2U keys on numpad, the first 1u row/column key assignment is the same as the 2u position.

Build requires a pro micro.

Can be built as single PCB with custom case, or as two PCB style with standoffs.
