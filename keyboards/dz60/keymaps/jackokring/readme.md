# DZ60

My first keyboard edit. A multi-layer ANSI-60 with layers and function shift on each layer.
Changes from the default keymap include moving RESET, and a prefered arangement for the cusor
block of keys. The function key was exchanged with the right control key to get it.

## Right Windows is Application Context Menu Instead
The right Windows key is for getting the application context menu. The right Windows GUI
key is not often used. It is available on the macroboard shift layer for completeness.

## Common to All Fn Layers
