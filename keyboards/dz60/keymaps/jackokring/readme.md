# DZ60

My first keyboard edit. A multi-layer ANSI-60 with layers and function shift on each layer.
Changes from the default keymap include moving RESET, and a prefered arangement for the cusor
block of keys. The function key was exchanged with the right control key to get it.

## Common to All Fn Layers
* Space is ANSI layer select.
* Left control is navigation layer select.
* Left win is macroboard layer select.
* Left alt is numpad layer

## ANSI Layer
* Right control exchanged with function shift key.

## Keyboard Control Layer (Fn ANSI)
* Scroll lock placed on caps lock.
* Right alt/win/control/slash form cusor block
* Backslash is insert.
* Backspace is delete.
* F1 to F12 form top row numbers and minus/equals.
* Square bracket are home and end.
* Comma and period are page up/down.
* Semicolon is pause.
* Apostrophy is print screen.
* RGB controls are Q-I.
* Backlight controls are C-N.
