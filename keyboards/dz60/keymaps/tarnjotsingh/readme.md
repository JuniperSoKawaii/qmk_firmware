# DZ60 ISO Keymap

Custom keymap for UK ISO keyboard layouts.
This includes 3 different layers.

-   Layer 0:
    -   Standard ISO layout with main modifier key, for accessing layer 1, to the right of the space bar.
-   Layer 1:
    -   Layer that gives you access to pretty much everything else like the arrow keys.
-   Layer 2;
    -   Standalone layer only for modifying the lighting on the board. Keys for this purpose are mapped in the locations used by the default dz60 layout.
    -   You can access this layer by holding MO(1) (next to the space bar) followed by holding MO(2) which where the Left Alt key is positioned.

The layers.json file is included, so you can go to https://config.qmk.fm/ and upload it to view the layout of the keymap.
