# Lbibass's keymap for KBDFans DZ60 PCB


It's got split space, and arrow keys! left spacebar is backspace, middle is FN1, and right is space. It's similar to the HHKB style of caps lock, but instead of control it's command.
## 4 Layers

### it's got a bunch of layers, one for mac, and the other for windows. The first layer is mac, with MacOS keyboard controls. It has everything except for Launchpad and Expose, which QMK doesn't have support for. The key just above right arrow switches to a Windows layout.

### Layer 1
this has RGB underglow and backlight controls. It also has Reset, along with caps lock and mouse controls. Backlight controls are where they would be on a mac keyboard: F5 and F6. Mac Media and brightness controls are also here too.  

* PL:" - Mouse controls
* O - Btn 1
* { - Btn 2


### Layer 2

This is the windows layout. It's pretty handy, especially for playing games (which is all I use windows for). It switches space and backspace, making it easier to have your hands on wasd and still be able to jump. Control is now where command was, and it's generally a pretty basic windows layout. The center key on the spacebar still moves it up a layer when you hold it, up to layer 3.

### Layer 3

This has the function keys! And nothing else. I suppose I ought to add the backlight and RGB controls to this layer. I'll get to it eventually.
