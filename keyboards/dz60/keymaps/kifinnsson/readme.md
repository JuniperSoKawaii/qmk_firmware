# DZ60:kifinnsson

kifinnsson's Colemak angle mod ansi layout
-----------------
This is built as an ISO layout on the left and an ANSI layout on the right. This creates an [Angle Mod](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html) ANSI Colemak layout however row 4 has an extra key which I place between "B" and "K" and is used for my macros on layer 2. If you build one with my wonkyness feel free to use it as a template. If you didn't build as I did you are not going to have a good time. This a cleaned up / sanitized version for pubilshing upstream.
