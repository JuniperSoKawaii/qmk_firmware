kifinnsson layout
-----------------
Note: This is a constant work in progress for my daily driver, I do not recommend you use it as this is a ISO keyboard on the left and an ANSI keyboard on the right. On this mod-shifted colemak layout row 4 has an extra key which is placed between "B" and "K" which is used for a macro layer switch. This is a mod-shift and the dead key was a perfect use for another dedicated layer key. If you build one with my wonkyness feel free to use it as a template. If you didn't build as I did you are not going to have a good time. I may do a cleaned up version to publish to upstream but it will be a while.
