# More on Control Codes
As the post modern internet arrived, many of the ASCII control codes became obsolete as tgheir protocol handling nature was superseeded by the signalling layer of X.25 and the TCP/IP stack. The rest of this page descibes assignment that would be more suitable and indicative of the type of control needed for a human to computer control layer rather than the origional ASCII intent of a data link PPP control layer.
