# Default KBIC65 Layout

This is the default layout for the KBIC65, it is recommended that you create your own keymap tailored to your specific needs. It is ISO but holds mappings for all keys if you use the full KBIC65 layout (i.e., ISO + split backspace). If you do not use all keys in your layout the simplest thing is to ignore and place some other keycode in those positions.
