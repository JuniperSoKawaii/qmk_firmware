# Description
Mac and Windows profiles with special touches for the Mac profile.

NOTE: To switch profiles, hold both shifts then press 0 for Windows or 1 for Mac

## Windows Profile
Should be nearly identical to the default profile for GMMK Pro. Only major difference is the button next to F12 is now PrintScreen and clicking the rotary dial switches profiles instead of muting.

## Mac Profile
Besides the usual swapping of the alt and windows/cmd placement also changes the following:
* Double press shift to activate caps lock
* Capslock is num pad layer.
* Button next to F12:
    * 1 press: play/pause
    * 2 presses: skip
    * 3 presses: previous
