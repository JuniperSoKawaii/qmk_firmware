# theborv's first test run of uploading keymap.c for gmmk/pro/iso
- My first functioning keymap. RGB works. Rotary knob works (this took a littel while to figure out). I haven't added anything that isn't already known on github. Some things that I wanted I haven't yet figured out.
- I added a macro which runs a batchfile.
- I haven't changed previous author's names in the uploaded files, they are left as they came.
