= ViToni's keymap for GMMK Pro ISO

== Layout
Based on the stock layout but making use of CAPS as FN similar to laptop keyboards.
This frees up the left row for other uses (although not remapped yet).
Since both Delete and Insert are used for coding they are part of the CAPS layer as well.

The differences are as follows:

=== Layer 0 (`_BASE`)
Mostly stock + CAPS goes to layer `_MOV`.
FN toggles the layer `_RGB`.

=== Layer 1 (`_MOV`), accessed by pressing `CAPS` on layer `_BASE`
