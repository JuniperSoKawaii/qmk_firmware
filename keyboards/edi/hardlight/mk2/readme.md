# Hard Light Mark 2

A compact 60% keyboard designed by Fate Everywhere. Born out of the desire for a Planck with a numpad for technical work and a lack of reliance on the Elite-C. Now includes the majesty of 32-bit computing and elaborate LED underlighting rig that makes Mk 1 look like it's from the 80s.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Fate Everywhere](https://github.com/fateeverywhere)
* Hardware Supported: Rev 2F and Mark 2 Hard Light.
* Hardware Availability: [Seven Store](https://store.7storm.org).
