# archetype keymap for jj50 keyboards
A keymap that can be used with the jj50 ortholinear keyboard.

## Features

- `QWERTY` layout (Default)
- `COLEMAK` layout
- `FN` layout (various keys that are rarely needed)
- `FX` layout (Control lighting and audio)
- Use `Left Ctrl` and `Left Alt` to output `()`, `[]` and `{}` by tapping once, twice or thrice respectively. Hold them down for the regular keycode (LCtrl or LAlt)
- `Right Shift` when held or Enter when tapped
- Auto-Shift enabled (long press on alphas and numeric keys outputs shifted character)
- Full arrow keys available

## Custom Keycodes

- All `______` keycodes are pass-through keycodes. This means that the key on the immediately previous layer will be invoked. See documentation for `KC_TRNS` for more information.  

- All `__XX__` keycodes are no-action keycodes. This means that there will be no action by the keyboard. See documentation for `KC_NO` for more information.

## Feedback

I made this keymap based on the existing default one. If you happen to use this keymap [drop me a line](mailto://idimitrakopoulos@gmail.com) about what could be improved etc

Enjoy!
