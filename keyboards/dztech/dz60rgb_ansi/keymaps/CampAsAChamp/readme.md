# CampAsAChamp's DZ60RGB_ANSI V2 Layout

This is the my custom layout is losely based on the Pok3r 60% keyboard layout.
There are a few changes which I've made to help reach some of the harder to reach characters that I find myself using frequently.

-   **Space Cadet Shift** - When `shift` key is held it functions like normal; When you tap the left shift key however you get a left parenthesis `(`. Tapping the right shift key gives you a right parenthese `)`.
-   When `Ctrl` is held, it functions like normal; When you tap `left Ctrl` however it will send a `[`. Tapping `right Ctrl` will send a `]`.
-   Holding the `Caps Lock` key will allow you to access another keyboard layer(1) to provide easy access to common keys that I use while not having to leave the home row.
    -   Volume and music controls are near the caps lock key `QWE` & `ASD` to allow for changing volume or music with only one hand.
    -   Arrow keys on `IJKL` to easily be able to access arrow keys while my hands don't have to leave the home row. Also have home and end on the side of the 'arrow keys' to quickly go to the start or end of a line while editing text.
-   Holding the `Select` key(next to the `right Alt`) while tapping one of the specified keys provides access to the keyboard layer(2) for controlling the SMD RGB LEDs built into the keyboard.
-   **Reset** signal on the `\` in the second function layer to quickly and easily put the keyboard into DFU mode to flash new firmware.
-   `Caps Lock` toggle in layer 2 as I'd still like to have access to Caps Lock but it can be tucked away in a layer as I don't use it too often.
-   The only unusual key is the key in the upper left, which sends `Esc` normally, but `~` when any of the Ctrl, Alt, or Shift modifiers are held down before pressing Esc; and sends Grave `` ` `` when the Win key is held down before pressing Esc.
