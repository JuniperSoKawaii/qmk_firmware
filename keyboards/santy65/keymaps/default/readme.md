# Default santy65 Layout

This is the default layout. 
For the most part it's a straightforward and easy to follow layout.
The sides are split up and the rotary encoders count as a button.
The only unusual thing is that the trackball also takes up a button, so the 7th key on the bottom row should always be KC_TRNS.
