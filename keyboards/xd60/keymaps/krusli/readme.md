# krusli's Keymap for XIUDI's 60% XD60 PCB

## Additional Notes
Keymap for the XD60 with 2.25u left shift and split backspace.

Notable things:
- I don't use RShift - it is remapped it to `KC_SLSH`.
- the number follows the HHKB layout for the split Backspace.
- Caps Lock is remapped to Fn.

## Build
To build this keymap, simply run `make xd60:krusli` on the top-level directory for QMK.
