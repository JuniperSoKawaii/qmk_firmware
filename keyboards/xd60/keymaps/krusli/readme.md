# krusli's Keymap for XIUDI's 60% XD60 PCB

## Additional Notes
Keymap for the XD60 with 2.25u left shift.

Notable things:
- I don't use RShift at all and remapped it to `KC_SLSH`
- the top row follows the HHKB layout as I split my Backspace key

## Build
To build this keymap, simply run `make xd60:krusli` on the top-level directory for QMK.
