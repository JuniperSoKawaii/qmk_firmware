# suryanisaac's layout

Just my custom layout, works really well for me so hopefully you guys like it.

## Features:

- Arrow keys on IJKL on Layer 1
- Layer 1 toggle is the Caps Lock (No one likes caps lock)
- Nav keys close to arrow keys, good for programming
- Non-convoluted media control
- For Mac or Linux with Kinto
- Left and Right arrow keys on left shift and right shift
