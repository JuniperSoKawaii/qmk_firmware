# Default layout with a more sane amount of layers

Layout created by: [Klaus Weidinger](https://github.com/dunkelziffer)

The generate_km.py file automatically generates comments within keymap.c that visually represent the layout.

This layout will not be maintained, as I am not using it, but you can use it as a starting point to create your own layouts for the Signum 3.1 with "km_template.txt" and "generate_km.py".
