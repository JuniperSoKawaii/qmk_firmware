The default keymap for Gingham
==============================

![Layout image](https://imgur.com/gallery/RqUENIl)

The first layer contains regular keys and the right function key is used to switch
to layer two.

The second layer maps arrow keys to WASD, uses + and - to change system volume, 
and maps the right menu key to layer two. 

The third layer includes all the RGB underglow controls with escape toggling
the underglow.
