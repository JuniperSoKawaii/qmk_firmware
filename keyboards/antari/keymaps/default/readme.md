# The default keymap for Antari

Because every people have their specific keymap setting, i decided setting up the default keymap with alphabet keycode so you can edit every keycode as you want and compile your own firmware later. If you decided with rotary encoder it's function as system volume.
Analog potentiometer, rotary encoder, RGB underglow, and passive buzzer for layer indicator enabled by default. Oled lcd feature will be update later.
