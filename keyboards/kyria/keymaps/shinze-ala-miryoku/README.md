# An adaptation of Hanna Harbour Miryoku Layout

## Description

Tried to adapt, [https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku](this layout) to my personnal needs :

1. A [Bépo](bepo.fr/) layout (needed to break the first general principle of this layout…);
2. Adapt it to a Kyria keyboard;
3. I’m only using Macos so I needed to invert Control and Command keys.

## Notes

- I removed all the conditions from the original layout as it’s a Bépo Mac only layout;
