# Readme for hjklapp's kyria layout

The only features enabled si `config.c` are OLED and mouse keys. I am not sure I will use the mouse keys.

Everything concerning the OLED is in `oled.c`.


Todos:
- [ ] Simple OLED stuff

Ideas:
- Move away the media keys from navigation layer
- Add window management and navigation keys (and choose software side)
- use tri layer for F-keys and such
- show layout on OLED (just one :/ )
- configure PERMISSIVE_HOLD_PER_KEY
