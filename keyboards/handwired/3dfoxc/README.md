# 3dfoxc

A 3d-printed whitefox with an Elite-C microcontroller

This is a build of [matt3o's "How to Build a Custom Keyboard" guide](https://matt3o.com/book/), except that I have replaced the Teensy with an [Elite-C v4](https://keeb.io/products/elite-c-low-profile-version-usb-c-pro-micro-replacement-atmega32u4). Presumably you could replace it with anything compatible.

## Wiring

Badly, because I have never done this before.
