# handwired/petruziamini

![handwired/petruziamini]

My first handwired projec. My hoping is to learn how to use github and qmk firmware in one shot.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [LLLKST](https://github.com/LLLKST)

* Hardware Availability: *i will compile this later if it will work. I will also increase my level of english, i promise :)*

You can find the case stl on printables.com searching for the PetruziaMini Handwired Keyboard
