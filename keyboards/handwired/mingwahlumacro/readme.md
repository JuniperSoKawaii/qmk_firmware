This is a 2x4 macropad that I made using with a 3d printed case I found off of thingiverse.

* Hardware Supported: *The PCBs, controllers supported*
Arduino Pro Micro x3: https://www.amazon.ca/KeeYees-ATmega32U4-Development-Microcontroller-Bootloader/dp/B07FXCTVQP/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=arduino+pro+micro&qid=1598387302&sr=8-5
I suggest putting a dab of super glue on the usb port to strength in it.
