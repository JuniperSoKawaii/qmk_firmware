# NoStab63

\*As the name implies, this keyboard has no stabilizers and instead shortens all the keys to a size that is also normally found in its row. For example the space bar was shortened down into 4 keys, all of which are 1.25u, which is the size of the command keys on the bottom.

\*It uses the proton C, which was a complete pain to work with, but extremely satisfying once it worked.

\*This build also has the EC11 rotary encoder.

\*I decided to go caseless since this will just be a backup keyboard.
