*Description*

This is a basic layout for a full-sized ANSI board. It should be compatible with any 100% full-sized layout, for example [RobotDoctor's MECH-104](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4205065).

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Cian Johnston](https://github.com/johnstcn)
* Hardware Supported: TeensyÂ®++ 2.0 as it has enough pins for the matrix.
* Hardware Availability: [pjrc.com](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html)

*NOTE:* Be sure to avoid pin D6 on the Teensy!
