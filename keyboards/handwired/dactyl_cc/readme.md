*Ergo S-1*

Modelled on the *Kinesis Advantage* (KA) 1|2, though missing it's function and program row, board(s) retain the finger and thumb key placements of the KA but opt to psychically split the handed key-wells instead.

Electronically both the Dactyl-CC and Ergo S-1 are indentical, though psychically the Ergo S-1 has larger casing designed to be used as a palm rest.

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
