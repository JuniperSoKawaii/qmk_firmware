Ergonomic PSeudo SPlit 75-key Keyboard. Desinged after two years of working with a [Truly Ergonomic CLEAVE Keyboard](https://trulyergonomic.com) and also inspired by the [Redox Keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard).
I am using and the [NOTED](https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/noted/) layout and the [ReNeo](https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/reneo/) software which offers additional possible key functions and layers.
