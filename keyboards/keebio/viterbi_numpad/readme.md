Viterbi (numpad variant)
========================

A repurposing of the right half of a regular Viterbi (rotated) for use as a numpad with a few extra keys.
This is probably not useful for anybody apart from me, but I have a spare right PCB and need a numpad.

I haven't included a rev1 version, since I only have a rev2.
