### 3 encoders layout

layout designed to be used with a trackball - in my case, a [ploopy nano](https://github.com/ploopyco/nano-trackball)

left encoder is CTRL+TAB, middle is GUI+TAB, right is volume.

### layers

layer zero is for mouse buttons and copy/paste

|   |   |   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| enter | enter | mute |
| v | c | rgui |
| left click | momentary layer 1 | right click |

layer one is basically wheel up/down.

|   |   |   |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| enter | enter | mute |
| wheel up | tab | gui |
| wheel down | (held down since we're in layer 1) | tab |
