### 3 encoders layout

layout designed to be used with a trackball - in my case, a [ploopy nano](https://github.com/ploopyco/nano-trackball)

left encoder is GUI+TAB, middle is CTRL+TAB, right is volume. left+middle push is enter to select, right push is mute

layer zero is for mouse buttons and copy/paste

layer one is basically wheel up/down.

| wheel down | (held down since we're in layer 1) | tab? |
