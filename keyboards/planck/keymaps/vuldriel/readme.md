# a keymap that features mousekeys, rgb_matrix LEDs per-layer and to indicate caps lock, num lock and scroll
# lock, sounds for the latter three, some probably horrible tap dance functions so I can access numpad 
# hotkeys (Ã±), some encoder shenanigans and pretty much everything that can go wrong in a keymap and still
# function somehow

# Also yes I have activated both RGBLIGHT and RGB_MATRIX, but as the RGBLIGHT code only activates when the
# keyboard is put into reset mode, it doesn't interfere with the RGB_MATRIX layers. The RGB keycodes
# therefore run via RGB_MATRIX.
