# tomholford's layout

This layout is data-driven: I installed WhatPulse a few months ago and generated a heatmap of the most frequently used keys. I also optimized for my most-used programming languages, and muscle memory.

## Changes

### QWERTY

- swap escape and tab
- rearrange arrows in original layout
  - to accomodate, move / to where left arrow was
- swap rshift and Enter
- map os to left arrow key

### RAISE

- move backslash to backspace
- map quote to original location from qwerty layer
- map slash to original location from qwerty layer

### LOWER

- move pipe to backspace
- map quote to original location from qwerty layer
- map slash to original location from qwerty layer
