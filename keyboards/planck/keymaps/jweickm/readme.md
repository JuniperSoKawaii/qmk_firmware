# Semi-wide German/English MIT Planck Layout
Added keymap for my planck MIT.
It has a German and an English switching mode, so that it works the exact same with both OS languages.
It is a semi-wide layout, with the left hand all the way to the edge, and with one extra column in the middle used for media controls.
Home row mods implemented in the top row with individual tapping_terms for different fingers.
Mouse layer accessible through the pinkies.
Navigation layer on space.
