# MJT's Planck layout, based on default with some tweaks.

Summary of adjustments:

1. KC_POWER to make MacBook sleep (raise + lower + "L"" (shift(control(power))?
3. Add arrow key "raise" keys for home, pgup, pgdn, end
6. Enable dynamic macros https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/0f119e09a57c53cd44572dc958d316bb979ce298
7. Remove Colemak and Dvorak layouts
8. Added dynamic macro layer to lower-left button

And some stuff I might do:
