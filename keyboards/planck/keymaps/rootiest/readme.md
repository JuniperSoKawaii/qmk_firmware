# The Rootiest Planck Layout

This layout takes advantage of as many QMK features as possible for a huge complicated beast of a keyboard. It also icludes encoder, speaker, and rgb_led functions with plans to include oled display features as well!

To build and flash this keymap, use this command:

    qmk flash -kb planck/rev6 -km rootiest
