# Sam's Dvorak Layout Optimized for Coding

The goal of this layout to keep as many of my most used keys as near to the home row as possible.

For the home layer, I like how dvorak optimizes the home row and keeps a lot of puntuation nearby. I have tab in kind of a funny place, and a dedicated shift+tab key. The alt, shift, and control keys are mirrored on both sides so they are accessible for both hands. Lastly, there is one dead key which I will find a use for eventually.

In the lower layer, you control movement with your left hand simular to WASD and number input with your right hand.

The raised layer is responcible for the characters that cannot fit on the home layer, and each character has its own key. I gave the different types of brackets a lot of priority as they are used quite a bit, and same with the comparison operators (=, &, |)
