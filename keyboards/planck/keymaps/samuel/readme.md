# Sam's Lefthanded Dvorak

I like to type a lot, but coding gives me some strain. I made this layout to help me type faster and with less movement. Since I like to use the mouse, I placed a lot of focus onto the left hand for as much as I could. I am also left handed so this feels natural to me.

To look at the layout look at the keymap c file. There are 3 layers not including the base, dvorak layer. Besides these layers, most of the bottom row and side columns are symetrical; basic shift, tab, control, alt, and gui (windows) keys. Your thumbs control either the alt keys, all 3 of the layer keys, and a space key. The layer below the "h" key on the right side is where I placed symbols that I would only probably need to type if I was using my right hand. To the left of the space are two more layer keys, one below the "i" key and one below the "e" key. One of these layers creats a number pad under your left hand, while the other layer gives a lot of data manipulation keys and arrow keys without having to lift a finger.

Now, when I type, my fingers need to travel much less distance, and I do not need to move from mouse to keyboard or back nearly as often.

Thank you QMK!
