# The VanDusartz Planck Layout

Designed for Planck rev5 this layout had modes for both Mac and PC
including macros that I find helpful. This layout puts emphasis on
thumbs and de-emphasizes pinky fingers by putting modifier keys on
the thumbs, and widens the standard layout leaving the pinky finger
only responsible for 4 keys at most.
