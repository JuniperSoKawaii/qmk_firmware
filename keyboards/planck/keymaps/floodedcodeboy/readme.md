# The Backlit-Feedback Planck Layout

This layout is mostly similar to the default planck layout and is intended for the drop-planck 6.1 pcb (although it also works on a 6.0 pcb without backlight)

## Differences

* Modifiers (raise, lower, lshft, lctrl, laft, lgui) all have visual feedback.

* Some Layers were _removed_:
  * DVORAK
  * COLEMAK
  * PLOVER

* Makes use of a set of arrow keys in-place of `hjkl`
  * and does this by swapping the `/` for an arrow key

* Backlight has 4 animations enabled 
  * static
  * breathing
  * twinkle
  * rainbow mood

# WARNING

Using this layout will result in some flashing lights.
