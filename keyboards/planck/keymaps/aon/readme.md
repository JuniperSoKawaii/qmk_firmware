#aonphl√©acs' Planck layout

##General Purpose

This layout is custom-built to take advantage of the Planck's cording capabilities. It is made for Dvorak and for controlling a bspwm session.

This layout is under construction and not complete by any means but is completely useable.

If you have suggestions for additions or improvements they are more than welcome.
