# ipetepete's planck layout
Planck rev3 (oldie but a goodie)

`sudo make planck/rev3:ipetepete:dfu` - sudo because I'm too lazy to setup udev rules

## Changes over default

### Space+FN

I added a function layer accessed by holding down space, this gives me the arrow keys under my right hand without having to move.

I also added the container characters (parens, brackets, braces) to the center column which makes quick access via the function layer.

Some other optimizations were done on the function layer to assist in programming, most of the symbols are accessible on the left hand.

### Hyper FTW!
The first key to the right of the Raise key acts as a hyper key wich allows me to have some custom shortcuts using [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net), such as Hyper+S (opens Safari), Hyper+E (opens Spacemacs), Hyper+z (puts the display to sleep).

### Raise is looking a bit barren

Because I'm using Space+FN for most of my movements, the raise layer is a little...useless at the moment. Still haven't decided how best to use this layer.
