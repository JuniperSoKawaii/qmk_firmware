# ipetepete's planck layout
Planck rev3 (oldie but a goodie)

Either: 
`make planck/rev3:ipetepete:flash` - if udev rules are in place or...
`sudo make planck/rev3:ipetepete:flash` - if not

## Changes over default

### Space+FN

I added a function layer accessed by holding down space, this gives me the arrow keys under my right hand without having to move.

I also added the container characters (parens, brackets, braces) to the center column which makes quick access via the function layer.

Some other optimizations were done on the function layer to assist in programming, most of the symbols are accessible on the left hand.

### Hyper FTW!
Custom workflow shortcuts using hyper is a super power!

### Colemak
Learning colemak...this might take a while
