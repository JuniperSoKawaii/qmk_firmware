# 3geek14's Planck layout

A QWERTY layout based on my Ergodox/Moonlander layouts. I got a Planck in part
because I broke my left thumb, and I wanted a board where my left thumb wasn't
as necessary (no thumb cluster). My thumb was somewhat better by the time I got
the board, so I was able to use the left layer key from the default layout.

Notable carry-overs from my other layouts:
* tap/hold to use CTRL from the [Z] and [/] keys
* tap/hold to use GUI from the ['] key
* tap dance to type ellipsis from the [.] key and en and em dashes from the [-]
  key
* a layer with various emoji macros and a numpad
