# ZWFP Layout Notes
## About

ZWFP is a layout largely based on Colemak Mod-DH.
The layout rotates the QZXVB keys for the following reasons:
* XCV are brought together.
  * One design goal of colemak was to keep ZXCV close together as they are commonly uses control shortcuts.
  * Mod-dh moved D to where the V key was as that position was too ergonomic for an infrequent letter like V.
  * XCV benefit more from being together are Cut-Copy-Paste are more related than Undo (which Z commonly represents).
* B is returned to its QWERTY position.
  * This was an unintentional benefit.
  * The original rotation of QZXV moved Q to a better position than B despite being was less frequent.
    * This is based off the grid on [the colemak mod-dh page](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/model.html).
    * This needs more testing, and may be reverted as despite the above mentioned grid, the current Q position feels easier than the current B position.
* Based off [the layout analyser](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html) its slightly better.
* I like being different.

## Todo
* Work out punctuation locations.
* Figure out what the thumb cluster is doing.
  * I've somewhat settled on left home-row (centre) thumb key is space and right is shift OSL.
* Swap M-K back, apparently I've somehow ended up using the DHk variant (despite using ergo?)
