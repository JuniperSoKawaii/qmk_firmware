The fancy keymap for the Ploopy Trackball Mini.

This modified keymap for the Ploopy Trackball Mini includes firmware Acceleration and support for a scroll mode
which can be toggled by enabling/disabling NumLock on a separate device (such as your keyboard).

CapsLock puts the device into bootloader mode.
