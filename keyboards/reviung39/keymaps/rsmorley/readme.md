# rsmorley's endgame config

### This config goes to endgame as t -> infinity

This layout has evolved through various 40% keebs. Starting with a JD40 ii
and then a MiniVan and finally a Reviung39s. The Reviung challenged me to 
whittle down my config to only the ensentials. This required that I learn
more advanced QMK features.

Layers 1 and 2 are accessed by holding Enter and Space respectively.
RGB controls TBD.

Bottom layer: Tap Enter, Hold Layer1    | Tap F3, Hold Cmd   | Tab Space, Hold Layer2
