# Denial75

I made this keyboard because I wanted to have a personal keyboard that matches my preferences. A spaced out 75% that I can change up the layout as I wanted. I also wanted to challenge myself with PCB Design and Coding. Please reach out to me for any questions or requests regarding the key layout (jolofsor@gmail.com). -- jolofsor

This is a collaboration with my buddy jolofsor into making a keyboard that suits his preference while also comemorating a stage of grief we went thru during Engineering college. I wanted to challenge myself in making a case that is made from stacked acrylic yet stylish enough for a custom mechanical designer keyboard. For any case or parts/logistics concerns you can reach out to me via polihaus2020@gmail.com or visit my page at Fb.com/pmx.gg. -- PMX
