MacroPad is powered by QMK, an open-source keyboard firmware. QMK allows users to fully customize the behavior of their keyboards, including MacroPad, by modifying the firmware.

MacroPad is also compatible with VIA, a user-friendly and powerful configuration tool for keyboards. VIA simplifies the customization process by providing a graphical interface, making it easier for users to program and configure their MacroPad.
