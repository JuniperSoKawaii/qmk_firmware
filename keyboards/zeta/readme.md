This is the keyboard otherwise known as the HalfPi, by [Southpaw Design](https://southpawdesign.net).

The HalfPi keyboard is a wireless, QMK-compatible orthogonal layout keyboard that can use Cherry MX, ALPS, or Kailh Low Profile "Choc" switches.  It is powered by a single CR2032 coin cell battery that  will last several months without needing replacement.  This keyboard is fully programmable.  It features an ON/OFF switch for power saving purposes and will prevent errant keypresses if you choose to travel with it.
