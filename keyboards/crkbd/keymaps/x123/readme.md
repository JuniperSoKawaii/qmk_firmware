# x123 Keymap for the Corne

This keymap is based on many concepts from Dreymar's big bag theory (see https://dreymar.colemak.org/index.html), tweaked a bit for my own preferences and adopted to the Corne.

## Features

- Supports both QWERTY and COLEMAK layouts
- Layouts switchable on the fly
- Homerow mods can be toggled (useful for gaming)
- Uses Tri Layers (see https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_tri_layer)
- Normal capslock key location has been replaced with backspace for ergonomics. Note that backspace is also placed in it's normal location for the QWERTY layouts (useful for letting others test the keyboard/layout)
- Uses Dreymar's EXTEND for the UPPER layer
- Keeps numbers and symbols on the LOWER layer, with all numbers accessible either along the home row (for two-handed operation), as well as invidually all numbers accessible for each individual side (for one-handed operation)
- Function keys and quick configuration settings on the ADJUST layer
- Designed to use RALT as a compose key

### LOWER

LOWER is where numbers and symbols live.

### UPPER

UPPER is basically a direct rip of Dreymar's EXTEND for small keyboards (see the very bottom image on https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html). This is where you'll find the arrow keys, navigation keys, mouse controls, and others.

### ADJUST

ADJUST houses the function keys, it also allows quick access to swap between default layers described above as well as issue a QK_BOOT to the keyboard for use when flashing.
