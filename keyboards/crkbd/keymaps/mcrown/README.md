# Keyboard layout by MCrown

This is all four layers:

- The top indicates the raise layer
- The middle indicates the default layer
- The bottom indicates the lower layer
- Green indicated ADJUST layer

All the keys respond as you'd expect to the 'shift' key - i.e. on a UK/GB keyboard, `/` becomes `?` and so on.
