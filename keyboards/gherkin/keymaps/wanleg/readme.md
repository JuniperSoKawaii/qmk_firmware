# Gherkin Wanleg Layout

Here is the layout I came up with to preserve a standard QWERTY layout as much as possible, in as few layers as possible for a 30 key board.
I originally set up a few Tap Dance keys, but dropped half of them in favor of chorded versions, since in actual use, they tended to impede typing speed more than their (current) two-key versions.
I've left them in my layout ready for use if anyone wants to try them out:

Legend Name | Single Tap | Double Tap | Hold
--- | --- | --- | ---
*null* | space | enter | shift
*null* | backspace | delete | control
Sft//Cp | shift | caps lock | *null*
Q//Esc | KC_Q | escape | *null*
