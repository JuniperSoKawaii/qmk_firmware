## Bluebearâ€™s custom S60X layout

Custom keyboard layout for my S60X, my first ever custom mechanical keyboard kit.

This layout was inspired in part by the HHKB line of keyboards and a quest to find the perfect ergonomic, logical layout for what I do. If you like this layout, please feel free to use it, modify it and share it.

## Base Layer

-Hold left control key for LCTL, and tap it for ESC
-Hold enter key for RCTL and tap for ENT
-Hold the space key to momentarily switch to [ARROW] layer
-Left bottom key acts as momentary switch to the [MOUSE] layer
-Hold right alt key for AltGr and tap for APP(which I have mapped to Compose in OS)
-Hold left shift key for LSFT and tap for ( (Space Cadet style)
-Hold right shift key for RSFT and tap for ) (Space Cadet style)
-Tap key on bottom row, second from the right (where APP usually is) to get CTL-Shift (one shot modifier - next key pressed will be modified by ctl-shift)
-Tap key on bottom right to get CTL-Alt (one shot modifier - next key pressed will be modified by ctl-alt)

## Mouse Layer

-Hitting the escape key in this layer will give RESET, which puts the controller into dfu mode for flashing firmware onto it
-Hitting the space key in this layer is like hitting power button on computer
