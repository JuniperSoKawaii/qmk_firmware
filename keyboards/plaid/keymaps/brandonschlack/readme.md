This layout is based on the Planck layout. It is macOS-centric, with Colemak and DVORAK removed as I don't use them.
Features include:

* **LOWER** and **RAISE** keys are Layer-Taps, so tapping **LOWER** will *Mute*, and tapping **RAISE** will *Play/Pause*.
* On either **LOWER** or **RAISE** layers, tapping *Shift* will toggle *Caps Lock*, hold for Shift.
  * The Green LED acts as a Caps Lock indicator.
* Bottom left key is *Hyper* (Shift+Control+Option+Command) which I use to map global shortcuts in macOS.
  * Holding *Esc* will also act as Hyper.
* **ADJUST** Layer
  * Make command for compiling keyboard firmmware, a Reset key, and Debug toggle.
  * Mission Control, Launchpad, and Sleep Display macOS macros
  * Alt-Gui swapping
