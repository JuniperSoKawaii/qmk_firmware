This layout is based on the Planck layout. It is macOS-centric, with Colemak and DVORAK removed as I don't use them.
Features include:

* LOWER and RAISE keys are Layer-Taps, so tapping LOWER will mute, and tapping RAISE will Play/Pause.
* On either LOWER or RAISE layers, tapping Left Shift will toggle Caps Lock, hold for Shift.
* The Green LED acts as a Caps Lock indicator.
