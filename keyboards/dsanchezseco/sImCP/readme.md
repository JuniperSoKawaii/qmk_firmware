This keyboard(more like a macro pad) is something "special" as it includes, in addition the regular keys and encoders, a 2-way switch and a 4-way+push+encoder "joystick" (codename dobber) to emulate and merge the different aircraft up front controlers(UFC) and input control panels (ICP), mainly a mix of the F-18 and the F-16 panels
