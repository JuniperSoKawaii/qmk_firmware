# The default keymap for the Navi10

This keymap keeps a basic Navigation Cluster layout, but utilizes the Insert key as a FN/Tap key to access 2 layers.

- Base Layer: 
  * Navigation Cluster (sans Insert Key)
- Hold Insert -> Function Layer: 
  * Maps Volume Control on PgUp/PgDN, Pause/Scroll-Lock on Home/End (MacOS brightness), and Delete to Enter. 
- Tap Insert Once -> Media Layer (Tap again to leave): 
  * Has mappings for Audio control on MacOS using the arrow keys, PgUp/PgDn, and Delete.
  * Lights up the Central 3mm indicator LED.


- added an rgb  stri0p for layer identification 
 
 added an additional few layers, and have tappy key working for single, doublke and triple tap.
