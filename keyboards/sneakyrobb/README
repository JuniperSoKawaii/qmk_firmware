See change log for changes.

The original source used Purdea Andrei xwhatsit code that was retrieved on
24 June 2021.

Disclaimer:
The firmware compiles. At the time I created this document I have no way to test
the firmware.


Changes to Source Files
-----------------------

- File System
-- Changed matrix.c to xwhatsit_capsense_matrix.c
-- Changed matrix_manipulate.h to xwhatsit_capsense_matrix.h
-- Changed util_comm.c to xwhatsit_util_comm.c
-- Changed util_comm.h to xwhatsit_util_comm.h
-- Updated all of the keyboard config.h
-- Updated all of the keyboard rules.mk

- Source Changes
-- Moved defines from source to headers
-- Replaced define macros with functions

Refactored the Build
--------------------
The QMK reviewers wants the keyboard directory index by organization. I have
refactored Purdea Andrei code into the three organization of ibm, model_f_labs,
and sneakyrobb.

In my git branch there are new directories:
keyboards/ibm
keyboards/model_f_labs
keyboards/sneakyrobb

I copied the organization directories from the original source into the
keyboards directory.

In the root each of the organization keyboards directories I added a xwhatsit
sub-directory. This is where I placed the xwhatsit source. The contents of this
directory are likely what should be moved into QMK core.

I removed the hardware "type"  / "style from the original xwhatsit/post_config.h
file. I placed the hardware details into each keyboard's config.h.

Type / Style
- Define cause in original post_config.h

universal (through_hole)
- CONTROLLER_IS_THROUGH_HOLE_BEAMSPRING
- CONTROLLER_IS_THROUGH_HOLE_MODEL_F

Finely I updated the needed files with the updated file paths.


Possible Issues
---------------
In the config.h files the strings for the "MANUFACTURER" and "PRODUCT" may be
too long. These strings are sent as part of the USB handshake. They are the USB
device descriptors iManufacturer and iProduct.


Other
-----
Removed util directory. This firmware not utility software. The utility should
have it's know repo.
