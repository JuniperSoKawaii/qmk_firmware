# A keymap for German users

Initial release.

A keymap for German users of the XD75RE keyboard, customized to my needs. 
Designed to ease transition from staggered layouts, with the most important keys
in the same positions. 
Normal German Alphas, no menu key, no left GUI, no right Ctrl and Shift.
4u Space, 2u Backspace and Enter. Navkeys on default layer. 
Second layer with Numpad, Insert, Menu, Multimedia and Underglow controls. 
Idiotproof Reset button.


Release 1.1

Added Printscreen to second layer.
Added shortcut to Launchy to AltGr.

Release 1.3

Now using PoS keys for 2u keys, added dummy keys accordingly (not strictly necessary since debouncing handles this, but without this you'll have double input rarely.)
Cleaned keymap up & removed unnecessary layers. 

Release 1.4
Fixed position of the reset key, replaced right spacebar with backspace.
