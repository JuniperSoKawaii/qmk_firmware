# emdarcher's keymap

Uses a tweaked 60% layout with split shift and up/down arrows in the bottom right. Resulted from being used to 65% boards with arrows in bottom right and using the up/down arrows a lot in terminal. 

- Page Up/Down, and Home/End have been mapped to the up/down keys on different layers.
- The Caps Lock Layer uses VIM style directions on HJKL keys.
- LGUI moved to Mac Command Key location
- Third "Alt Layer" that has arrows on IJKL for one-handed arrow key control.
