## Dynamic Macros

Enable the DYN layer, then press "O" to record macro 1 and P to record macro 2.

When you are done recording, return to the dyn layer and press backspace.
This shouldn't be necessary but the way the layers are setup on this layout
seems to break the way dynamic macros normally work.

For playback of macros, the down arrow plays macro 0, up arrow plays macro 1.
