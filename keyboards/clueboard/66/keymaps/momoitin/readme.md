# Generated Keymap Layout

This layout was designed by Momoitin using the default Clueboard layout
as the base and removing all RGB functions from the control layer and 
replacing them with mouse function.

# BASE LAYER

Everything functions as an ansi layout, FN key switches to function layer

# FUNCTION LAYER

While FN is HELD

# Control and Mouse Layer

FN + Right Ctrl
Can either be held or tapped twice to hold that layer untill deactivated 
by tapping twice again
