# A MacOS-specific QWERTY layout for Clueboard 66 by [BlueTufa](https://github.com/BlueTufa)

## Layouts

### QWERTY
Standard QWERTY layer with MacOS GUI key layout, and ESC maps to MOVE layer when held down.  Dedicated Function key for ADJUST layer.

### MOVE layer
OS-specific convenience shortcuts.  Macros are defined to make it easier to adapt these to other operating systems.
Window move and resize, and jump to a specific virtual desktop.  Some keys from ADJUST layer are redefined here.

NOTE: The 9-key left-hand pattern requires the installation of the MacOS rectangle app:

`brew cask install rectangle`

### ADJUST layer
Access to all function keys as well as media controls and Quantum and keyboar settings.  Some useful OS action keys are defined here as well.  

## Future enhancements planned
The long term plan is to define different MOVE layers for each supported operating system and have them share a common ADJUST layer.  Changing between default QWERTY layers will determine which OS MOVE layer is used.  More time needs to be spent using this on a daily basis to figure out which keys are are useful across operating systems before investing in that.
