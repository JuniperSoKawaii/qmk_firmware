# Oh Hi.
I'm just getting started working with keyboards, and my local fork of QMK won't be as useful for you. But if you're just looking for what I have here, cheers.

At the outset, this is intended to be a workspace for building a couple of really interesting Corne layouts and experimenting with improving my typing experience. I got a Corne from Ergomech with hot swap Chocs, but the fitment was imperfect. I'm still working on getting a custom keymap flashed to it correctly and expect this repo to be a mess for some time.
