How to put PCB into Bootloader (DFU):

on glyphkbd_v2 PCB, bootloader can accessed by holding down the BOOT switch on the backside while plugging it into USB or pressing the RESET switch. Or, if the PCB has already been loaded with this firmware, it can be put into DFU mode by holding down Esc key (0,0 in the matrix) while plugging into USB or pressing RESET.
