# Atlantis

A company that seemed to have built a reputation creating some unorthodox styled keyboard layouts, for example the AK82 a 60% layout with a numpad (pictured commonly on the left, however a right side variant AK82_VE exists) and rotary encoder.

Atlantis don't only create unorthodox layouts however, they produce some more traditional layouts like the AK81 a 75% layout PCB (AK81_VE variant includes a rotary enconder).

Atlantis seem to be operating mainly out of Malaysia, can be difficult to source internationally.
