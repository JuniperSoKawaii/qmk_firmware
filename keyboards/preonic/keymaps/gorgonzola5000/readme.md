# Preonic Single Spacebar One Shot Keys Heaven

A highly customized Preonic keymap with a focus on having a full keyboard functionality (missing only numlock and menu keys) and one shot keys

## Key features
- all modifiers are [one shot keys](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/one_shot_keys) and placed on the bottom row
- no capslock - similar functionality can be achieved by tapping shift twice (or any other one shot modifier or one shot layer key)
- clear all active modifiers and layers using a custom keycode in the bottom left corner
- numpad, arrows, function keys and media all accessible as one shot layers
- delete key as shift + backspace
- F13 and F14 keys in the bottom right corner for macros or shortcuts

## Layers
- default layer
- numpad, mathematical operators and keys useful in programming
- arrows and other keys (home, pageUp, etc.)
- media and function keys

### Reasons for some of my choices
- arrows are placed on ESDF keys instead of WASD - this is because I switched from using WASD to ESDF in games to always keep my fingers on the default keys on the homerow
- shift and alt gr only accessible using thumbs - this adds some purpose to these fingers instead of just tapping the spacebar
