## SpaceFN _The most awesome use of Space_

This layer adds arrow keys under the right hand on the home row, just hold space. Also...

Under the left hand
- Home
- End
- PageUp
- PageDown

Center columns house the ever useful [],{},() on TY, GH, BN respectively.

## Gamer 

This is the base layer but with SpaceFN turned off so space acts normally, you know for like jumping and stuff.

## Other conveniences

Tap `Esc` for `Esc` hold for `Ctl`. Much easier to do shortcuts with the pinky.

Tap `Enter` for `Enter` hold for `RSFT`. If you learned to touch type by using the "correct" shift key, this gives
you right shift where it would normally be on a staggered keyboard.
