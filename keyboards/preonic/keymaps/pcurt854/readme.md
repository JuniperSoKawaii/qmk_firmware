# For programmers having trouble touch typing the top row

### My problem and using preonic to solve it

I am an okay letter typist, but often need to look and find special symbols, like $ and ^, on the top row.

The numpad on a full-sized keyboard is helpful.  But it's simply too far away.  Staggered keyboard makes it awkward to move the numpad in.  Preonic is ortholinear, and of the right size.  It's quite natural to move the numpad in on a preonic.

Special symbols like $ and ^ are assigned to keys corresponding to their names.

For programmers, parentheses, brackets, and braces are important.  They are moved to the middle of the keyboard in an easy to remember layout as well.

### Layer 0

The middle section, from 1 to 0, plus three rows of letters, follows the traditional QWERTY layout.

The left border, from top to bottom: Esc when tapped and ~ with Shift and ` with Command, Tab, Esc when tapped and Control when held, and One shot layer 5.

The right border: Backspace, Tap dancing leader key, quotes, and Cap locks when tapped and Right shift when held.

Bottom row, left to right: One shot modifier Left shift, Control, Option, Command, One shot layer 4, Enter, Space, Layer 3 double tap to toggle, Left, Down, Up, and Right.

### Layer 1

Middle: Colemak

Border: Same as QWERTY

### Layer 2

Middle: Dvorak

Border: Same as QWERTY

### Layer 3

Numpad and common operators around it.

Brackets <> () [] {}

Home/End/Page Up/Down in place of arrow keys.

### Layer 4

Special symbols using a character in their names:

pLus (+), eQual (=), pIpe (|)

anD (&), dollaR

At, Backslash, Circumflex, Exclamation, Grave, Hash, Percent, Star, Underscore

- is put on J so it's under Underscore, easy to access, and matches the bump on J 

### Layer 5

Layout switches and other special functions.

### To indentify layers

I turned on preonic RGB backlight for Cap locks and layers 3 and above.

### Tap dancing

With the leader key, the F colume becomes brackets: <> () [] {} from top to bottom.
1 tap: the pair, with the cursor returned to the middle
2 taps: the open bracket
3 taps; the close bracket
