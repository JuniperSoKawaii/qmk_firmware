# For programmers having trouble touch typing the top row

### My problem and using preonic to solve it

I am an okay letter typist, but often need to look and find $, ^, numbers, and so on, on the top row.

The numpad on a full-sized keyboard is helpful.  But it's simply too far away.  Staggered keyboard makes it awkward to move the numpad in.  Preonic is ortholinear, and of the right size.  It's quite natural to move the numpad in on a preonic.

Special symbols like $ and ^ are assigned to keys corresponding to their names.

For programmers, parentheses, brackets, and braces are important.  They are moved to the middle of the keyboard as well.

### Layer 0

The middle section, from 1 to 0, plus three rows of letters, follows the traditional QWERTY layout.

The left border, from top to bottom: ~, Tab, Esc when tapped and Control when held, Toggle layer 3, and CapLock when tapped and Left Shift when held.

The right border: Backspace, Delete, ", Up, and Down.

Bottom row, left to right: One shot layer 4, Control, Option, Command, Enter, Space, Left, Right, CapLock/Right Shift, and One shot layer 5.
