## Learnings
 1. Combos â€” Don't fuck with 'em. They made my keys feel sticky and increased typos. Would be great on macropad or something tho!


## Todos
- [ ] `L_DESIGN`: Right handed delete, zoom in and out
- [ ] `L_RAISE`: Add math operators to numpad
- [ ] `L_RAISE`: What else would be benefitial on this layer?
- [ ] Remove SRC from rules.mk? Music is cool and all...
