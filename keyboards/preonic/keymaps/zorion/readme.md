# ZORION - a handwired Preonic

This project is the result of a number of design goals:

- ortholinear layout
- handwired circuitry
- wooden plate/case
- minimalist design

I loved the concept of the Planck and other ~40% boards, but I couldn't give up my number row, so here we are.

## Digressions

- non-standard pin-out (based on how I "mounted" the microcontroller)
- no speaker (I was going to leave a PWM pin open, but then I didn't)
- the board is mainly Gateron Blacks, but I used 4 Blues in specific places, so that kind of locks the layout down
- no full backlighting, because I didn't want to deal with handwiring all of that, and because I don't have shine-through keycaps

## TODO

- enable tap-dancing to lock layers and implement caps lock
- turn on LEDs when a layer is locked
- cut a clear acrylic back plate
- explore QMK
