# Big Series PCB

Big switch that does tap dance, and works as a fancy light only.
The PCB was sourced from Woodkeys (Cole Markham);
Currently AWOL and scammed people out of their money (me personally for 150$)
Cannot recommend anyone try to obtain one of these PCBs.

My PCB to USB connector broke; and could not repair it yet.
Managed to obtain a custom glow in the dark keycap for this.

## Status
