## Layer 5: Windows Fn layer - `_FW`

### Accessed by holding either `Fn` key in Layer 0

Arrows, Navigation keys (Insert, Home, Page Up, etc.), and Function keys are here. Also has keys for Volume Control.

## Layer 6: MacOS-oriented Fn layer - `_FM`

### Accessed by holding either `Fn` key in Layer 1

Based on Layer 2, but swaps a few functions for a MacOS environment. Arrow, Navigation, and Function keys are basically unchanged from Layer 2. This layer enables using the Caps-as-Fn key as a sort of simulated `Command` key, which I find easier to reach and use.

## Layer 7: Quake 2 Fn layer - `_FQ`

### Accessed by holding either `Fn` key while either Quake 2 overlay is active.

Based on the Windows function layer, but removes some functions that are pointless to have while in the game.
