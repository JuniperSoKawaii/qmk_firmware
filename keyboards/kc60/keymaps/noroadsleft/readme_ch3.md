## Layer 4: Fn layer - `_FN`

- Accessed by holding either `Fn` key from any base layer

Arrows, Navigation keys (Insert, Home, Page Up, etc.), and Function keys are here. Also has keys for Calculator, Menu, Volume Control, and shortcuts for Select All, Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste. Numpad Enter for when I'm working in Adobe Photoshop, because it treats Numpad Enter differently from the regular Enter key.
