### TKL ISO keyboard based on an g80-3000HAD running QMK

Features  :
  - ATMega 32U4 @ 8 MHz (why the crystal ... such a waste, sigh)
  - USB-C jack **with FUSE and full ESD protection** (gnd vcc d+ d-)
  - MOSFET controlled bottom backlighting pads for 14 LEDs with resistors plus 2 extra 2mm connectors for lantern style lightning
  - Scroll and caps indicators (active low atm.. I kinda like it)
  - SPI interface and reset
  - 340mA overall power consumption with full lights (I put in UV / pink LEDs and 14 Ω Resistors)

designed with kicad nightly Version: (5.99.0-10004-g132ec37b56), release build

and some gimp
