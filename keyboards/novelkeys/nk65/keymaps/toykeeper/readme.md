ToyKeeper's NK65 Layout
=======================

A relatively straightforward 65% layout with some extras.

## At A Glance

Here's my NovelKeys NK65 with blue/white DSA PBT keycaps:

This is the layout internally, showing all the functions for each key:

## Core Features

Most of the features are shared by all my keymaps.  Check my
[user dir](../../../../../users/toykeeper)
for the details.

Everything below is specific to this particular model of hardware.


## Hardware-Specific Notes

Things which differ from other models:

  * Not much.  This is a standard 65% layout and is effectively the baseline to
    which other models are compared.


## Known Issues

  * RGB LED on/off toggle doesn't work, because the WilbaTech RGB code has no
    toggle function.

  * There are no responsive lighting effects... again because of WilbaTech.

  * The middle indicator LED doesn't seem to work.  It's possible mine may
    simply be broken.
