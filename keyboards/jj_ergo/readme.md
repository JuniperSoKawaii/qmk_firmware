Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make jj_ergo:default:flash

**Reset Key**: Hold down the key located at top left on the left hand board, commonly programmed as _ESC_ while plugging in the keyboard.  (NOTE:  If this doesn't work, try the lower left key on the lower left board, commonly programmed as _Control_.  There might be a different version of the board that uses that key as the reset.)
