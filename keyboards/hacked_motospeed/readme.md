# hacked_motospeed

This is a
    tiny (44key),
    budget (~50â‚¬ total expense),
    easy diy (little wiring & soldering needed),
mechanical keyboard.
It is made by wiring two Motospeed K22 numpads to a Teensy++ 2.0, while reusing as much of the original PCB as possible.
A detailed guide will be posted and linked.
