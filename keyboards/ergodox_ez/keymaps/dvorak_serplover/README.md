Dvorak support, plover support, gaming support

This keymap defaults to Dvorak, but has a layer that uses
the Gemini PR protocol of QMK's internal steno stuff for talking
to Plover -- much more convenient than the NKRO-derived
version. It also works nicely with my LCD display hack.

The result is probably a bit idiosyncratic, but it works for me.

I also don't have any press/hold distinction keys, because that
confuses my fuzzy little brain.
