# Kurth's Ergodox Layout

## Description

A standard QWERTY layout optimized to remove work for the little fingers by transferring it to the thumbs and index fingers. Those with vim motion muscle memory should find the navigation layer familiar. Throughout the design, a premium has been placed on replicating familiar patterns. The less one must think about typing the better.


The base layer (layer 0) is designed to be a familiar layout with little need to retrain muscle memory for the modifiers. As much work as possible has been transferred to the thumbs, with `CR`, `TAB`, `SPACE` and `BK SPACE` grouped in the thumb clusters, and symmetrically placed `SHIFT`, `CTRL` and `ALT`/`ALTGR` duplicated along the left and right hand bottom row to minimize the need for single-hand chording. `(` and `)` are also offloaded to the thumbs with Space Cadet `SHIFT`s. The index fingers capture much of the work typically left to a programmer's little fingers, with the characters `~`, `` ` ``, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `/`, `?`, `\`, `|` all mapped to the index fingers.

The navigation layer (layer 2, right hand) is designed to exploit the familiar vim bindings to `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`. Arrow keys, mouse movements, scrolling and paging are all mapped to the corresponding fingers, with only a row shift necessary to pass from the same direction mousing, line motions, scrolling and paging.
