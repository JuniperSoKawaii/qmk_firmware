# Keymap focused on programming

### Should be good enough to work with Windows and linux terminals, VSCode and emacs.

#### Objectives:
1. Easy access to symbols, prioritize `'` and `-`, followed up by `()`, `{}` and `[]`
1. Base layer arrow keys
1. Reasonably good access to F row keys, Delete, Insert and finally Home, End, PgUp and PgDn
1. Easier ctrl, shift, alt to prevent problems like 'emacs pinky' or wrist related. Also for enchancing the arrow keys
1. Good control/navigation of a windowed OS and in a browser with tabs: Alt+tab, GUI+tab, GUI+number
1. Provision for ISO letters. Last priority by far.

#### Solutions:
- Home Row Mods: this addresses points 4. and 5.
- SpaceFn: this addresses points 1. and 3. and enables 2.

#### Layers
The base layer and the first two layers are all you should need. All the rest are either media related or gaming related or fallbacks.
