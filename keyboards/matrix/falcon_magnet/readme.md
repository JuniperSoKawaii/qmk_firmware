# Falcon Magnet Switch keyboard

This was the PCB for Falcon and it supports the gateron magnet switch. Actually the PCB was based on the Falcon EC PCB and not optimized for the magnet switch,
and the matrix scan implementation can be also optimized. But it currently was a POC for the the magnet switch, so let it be.
