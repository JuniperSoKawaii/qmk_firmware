# Gamepad Layout by @wavebeem

The concept behind this layout is the left side of a computer keyboard,
optimized with essential keys for playing FPS games

The numbers 123 are missing for weapon switching, but you can usually switch
with the mouse wheel or rebind those to ZXC or something else.

The keys R and F are generally pretty useful too, but I typically bind those to
my mouse as well.

Note the easy access to all modifier keys potentially useful for gaming. Alt
isn't great since Alt-Tab will trigger your in-game keybinding for Alt, but I
think it's important to keep around in case a game wants it or you need to
Alt-Tab to leave a game.

# Layer 1

```
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Tab   | Q     | W     | E     |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Esc   | A     | S     | D     |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Shift | Z     | X     | C     |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| Fn    | Alt   | Ctrl  | Space |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
```

Currently there is only one layer, but I may add more layers later. Fn does
nothing yet.
