# Dvorak on the Minivan

This is a Dvorak layout for the Minivan 40% keyboard, default hardware
configuration (44 keys).

This keymap.c was edited from the default provided with this version of
QMK on Github, the other files left to what they where.

Led support does not seem to exist at time of writing.  The QMK on
qmk.thevankeyboards.com does have led support working.

When trying to copy the files (config.h, keymap.c, ...) from
qmk.thevankeyboards.com into this version of QMK on Github, it failed
to compile (implicit declaration of a led related function).
