Compile options ...
-------------------
These are the compile options, defined at the top of ![keymap.c](./keymap.c)

 - Hardware key configurations: _default_ (44), _arrow_ (45), _south paw_ (45), _arrow_ + _south paw_ (46).
 - What the additional hardware keys for _arrow,_ _south paw_ should be.
 - An arrow cluster for _arrow_ hardware configuration (on a layer).
 - Layouts: Dvorak¬≤ or Qwerty+Dvorak (see below).
 - Startup in the alternate BASE layer (for example Qwerty or Dvorak).
 - Navigation cluster in a triangle (WASD) or flat layout.
 - Switching the GUIs left/right.  
 - To what layer should _left shift_ toggle.
 - Change the symbol '∆í' Dutch guilder into a Euro symbol ‚Ç¨.

In addition the symbol üõ† can be easily reconfigured in `unicode_macros.c`.
There are some tokens to help port the layout to a board with 47 or 48 keys (`J1_J2`).

   
  Overview of layers
  - - - - - - - - - 

     Basic layers are:
      ‚Ä¢ letters (normal Dvorak layout), (Led: low-white/off)   _LTR "LeTteRs"
      ‚Ä¢ numbers with remaining symbols, (Led: blue 2x)         _NSY "Numbers SYmbols"
      ‚Ä¢ function keys,                  (Led: red & white ‚ÅΩ¬π‚Åæ) _FUN "FUNction keys"
      ‚Ä¢ and a movement layer            (Led: green 2x)        _MOV "MOVement"
     Extra layers: 
      ‚Ä¢ keys like Power, Play,          (Led: purple 2x)       _RAR "RARe keys"
      ‚Ä¢ number pad symbol versions      (Led: green/blue)      _PAD "numbers PAD"
      ‚Ä¢ accented characters √©, √∏, √ü ... (Led: cyan 2x)         _ACC "ACCented"
      ‚Ä¢ Unicode symbols, ¬π, ¬±, ¬∞ ...    (Led: yellow 2x)       _DRA "DRAwings"
     Descramble _Computer_ set Dvorak (activate automatic as drop-ins for above layers)
      ‚Ä¢ Unicode symbols, etc            (Led: cyan/low-white)  _DDD "Descramble Drawings"
      ‚Ä¢ accented characters             (Led: yellow/low-white)_DDA "Descramble Accented"
      ‚Ä¢ numbers                         (Led: blue/low-white)  _DDL "Descramble Numbers"
      ‚Ä¢ letters                         (Led: off/low-white)   _DDN "Descramble Letters"


      Leds: ‚Ä¢ Breathing effect on the middle LED in color of last active non base layer.
              There is no particular reason for this (fun & games).
            ‚Ä¢ Leds left and right indicate active layer.
            ‚Ä¢ ‚ÅΩ¬π‚Åæ One led on the _FUN layer is bright white, indicating which descramble
              mode is active (see below).
            ‚Ä¢ Leds can be switched on/off on the _RAR layer (MLed, SLeds).      

Compile option for: Dvorak¬≤ or Qwerty+Dvorak
--------------------------------------------
These keymaps can be compiled either in a Dvorak version which also allows typing
normally on a computer already set to Dvorak (Dvorak¬≤), or in a version that can
switch between Qwerty and Dvorak. 

This readme file assumes the Dvorak with Dvorak-descramble compile version (Dvorak¬≤).
For the layers in the Qwerty+Dvorak version, see ![qwerty dvorak.md](./qwerty_dvorak.md)

The right led in 'descramble' mode shows when using a layer that is different
in that mode, analogue to the `_FUN` led indicator for 'descramble' (not shown
in above graphics).

The 'descramble' system:

![Minivan descramble Dvorak](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_descramble.jpg)


  Usage
  =====
 
  Normal layer switching is by thumb buttons on the base layer (hold),
  and on the shifts (those are toggles). The layers can be set to be on
  persistently through the `_FUN` layer top row toggles. A few layers
  can only be reached by `_FUN` layer toggle. From each layer one can
  go back to the BASE layer by pressing the upper/left most button.

  'Descramble' mode
  -----------------

  There are several layers for that take care of typing normally on
  a computer already set to Dvorak ('descramble' mode.)  

  The keys on `_FUN` to layers that have a 'descramble' twin, switch to
  the normal layer variant in normal mode, and to the 'descramble' 
  variant when in 'descramble' mode. This includes the base layers
  `_LTR` (normal) and `_DDL` (descramble).

  Activation: go to `_FUN` layer, than touch the upper/right key 
  (Backspace on base layer). This cycles through the descramble modes.

      ‚Æö When the left led is white: normal mode.
      ‚Æö Right led white: full descramble mode (Linux descrambled Unicode input).
      ‚Æö Middle led white: half descramble mode, with normal Unicode input system.

  With the middle led set to white, you can take advantage of a Unicode
  input mode that works on your system, if it is the same when the
  computer is set to Dvorak or not (see `_RAR` layer for Unicode input
  encoding selection). This more or less means there is one more Unicode
  encoding option than already standard in QMK: 'descrambled' version of 
  Linux (Shift-Control-U HEX) encoding.

  To test it, (in Debian/Linux) go to a terminal in X and type (normal user)

        > setxkbmap -layout us -variant dvorak

  Undo:

        > setxkbmap -layout us

  Unicode on Windos may require to install something special.

     ¬π) 'South paw' hardware configuration (#define J1)
     ¬≤) 'Arrow' hardware configuration (#define J4)
     ¬π ¬≤) There are two more optional hardware keys (#define J2, J3), to make it easier to compile for
          a 12x12x12x11 or 12x12x12x12 layouts.

Remarks: The left modifiers have a slight delay in combination with an outside pointer device (mouse, stylus).
It seems this will be difficult to fix, because it is spread over two devices. To avoid the
¬±0.2 second delay, activate a layer where the modifiers are direct, using the layer toggle on left shift. 

The two keys with ';' (Del;`_ACC`, Right;`_RAR`) do not auto-repeat on double tap, like QMK normal layer-tap keys.
There is an uncluttered _Delete_ and _Right_ on the `_NSY` or `_MOV` layer respectively.

Holding both `_NSY` keys left and right of the "split space bar" results in layer `_DRA` (or
`_DDD` where appropriate, with the same result).

Remarks. √ú is a Unicode tester key. uLNX for Linux Unicode input encoding, uBSD
for BSD Unix, uWIN for Windos, uWNC for another Windos encoding. The
change is retained between on/off power cycles.

MLed switches on/off the middle led, SLeds switches on/off the side leds.

The keys marked with ‚Ä¢ require Shift to be activated, as a means of preventing 
accidents. Shift is on (BASE) 'space' which also reduces accidents (combinations
which are never pressed normally). The 'P' key in front is meant as a memory
assist.

  Why you want this layout
  ========================

  This layout is easy to learn and predictable. It has a lot on it.

  The Dvorak/Qwerty layer (BASE) is an unaltered standard Dvorak/Qwerty
  layout, except what physically cannot fit (numbers, right pinky
  symbols).  Despite the crammed space, you have left & rigth arrow,
  GUI, Backspace, Delete and Esc.  The tap keys are typically keys that
  you do not use when in fluent typing (enter, tab, etc).

  Every time you have 0-9 enumerations / numbers, they are on the same
  fingers as a standard keyboard, except on the home row (numbers,
  numpad numbers, F-keys, super- and sub-script numbers).

  The symbols normally reached by shifting a number, are also still on
  the same fingers: on the third row, accessed by pressing either
  thumb NUMS key.  You can reach the entire alpha-numerical set in two
  layers. There being a NUMS key for each hand makes the NUMS layer
  comfortable to reach left/right handed.

  The lowest symbols row on NUMS copies the logic that the braces are
  normally under right hand ring and pinky fingers (numbers 90), and
  therefore on this second row the parathesis and square brackets are
  also on the ring and pinky fingers.  All the unshifted symbols are on
  the left hand, and they mirror over in the shifted form to the right
  hand. The / next to \ is easier to recall (I think). Then come =+|?,
  which needs to be learned.

  On all layers possible / needed the modifiers are in their usual spots,
  and so is backspace, Delete.

  Because one often uses an F-key only once, the layer switches back
  to BASE after an F-key is used. This can be disabled/enabled with the
  appropriate key stroke on that layer. Because it is hard to touch more
  than 3 keys, there are modifier combination keys on this layer. The
  logic is that they are written left to right, starting from the top
  with Control plus Shift, then Control plus Alt, as if cascading down.

  Leds indicate what layer and mode you are in.

  The movement layer is fairly standard, and allows for mouse use. You
  may want to fiddle it to whatever you are used to.

  The layer with Power buttons protects you from accidental keystrokes
  on the critical keys. Media keys arrangement you may want to change
  to what you are used to. Otherwise it will have to be learned.

  The number pad layer is quickly in reach on tapping left space. This
  makes it easy to get to modifdiers Control, Shift and Alt without build
  in delays (unlike on BASE layer, where they must share the space with
  other functions). There are some blocks where the number pad navigation
  comes back, which makes it easier to remember where what is, but it
  is not so obvious. This will have to be learned if one uses those keys.

  The accented layer makes it possible to set the keyboard in a mode
  on the computer side without dead-keys. It makes it easy to remember
  where your accented characters are.  The upper row left for example
  has the vowels repeated, with accents going up. The letter '√•'
  is on the same finger as 'a' but other hand, '√ü' is on the spot of
  's', etc. Not all is logical however, or has vague logic (√Ω being
  'near y'). One will have to learn some things by heart. Some things
  are clustered, perhaps vaguely.

  The last layer adds a fair amount of fun stuff to spice up your
  writing. Some logic is fairly obvious such as ‚ÅΩ‚Åæ on the same keys as
  (), and quotation marks on the same keys as on the BASE layer, while
  others have vague or no logic to their placement such as ¬∞ (Degrees
  symbol), üôÇ and others, which would have to be learned. You also have
  'correct' quotation marks for some languages. Dutch: ‚Äûhe said‚Äù English:
  ‚Äúhe said‚Äù.
 
  With the 'descramble' mode, you never have to fear not being able to
  use your keyboard. This mode is completely seamless, everything works
  exactly the same.

  You could use the Qwerty+Dvorak compile version if you somehow have
  a use for both, but not for 'descramble' (typing Dvorak on a computer
  already set to Dvorak). Keymap.c has an option to easily change
  ∆í into ‚Ç¨.

  Conclusion: most is as normal or has some logic to it to help you
  remember, a bunch is better than your normal keyboard, some things
  rarely used will have to be learned.

  Use case
  --------
  The use case this keymap is designed for: PCs with GNU/Debian/Linux (etc),
  Linux laptop already set to Dvorak _hence 'descramble'_. Being able on the move
  to operate other operating systems owned by others _hence non-Linux
  Unicode modes._ Editing in vim / websites etc. _hence no dead keys,_
  programming (shell, C (like) languages) _hence decent access to basic
  symbols._ Writing in Dutch _hence accented characters_. Using a tiling
  window manager _hence a LGUI on base layer._ AltGr or Compose seemed
  difficult to configure / use _hence accented and symbols layer._ Compatibility
  with the Pok3r keyboard _hence the (non)shift symbols on row 2 left side._
  For use with 3D editing _hence a delete on base layer, Control, Alt, Shift on 
  left edge and quick toggle access to `_PAD,` on left shift for faster
  modifiers and tab key._ 

  It seems this keymap should be fine for most usual purposes.
  Some of the more recent key additions like an e-mail button is not on
  it, you can add things like that if you like obviously (some room left
  on `_RAR`.)


  Trouble shooting
  ----------------
  When you flash your board, suddenly your Unicode doesn't work, or your
  leds seem to be broken. What seems to happen sometimes is that after
  flashing the value of a user option ends up in a diffderent state than
  you expected.

  Leds not working: try going to `_RAR` layer, and hit the key MLeds and SLeds,
  which switch Leds on/off.

  Unicode is chaos: try going to `_RAR` layer, and hit the Unicode operating
  system buttons.
 

  BUGS
  ----
  (Unknown at time of this writing.) Only tested on Linux (FIXME).

  Todo
  ----
        - Other _ACC, _DDA layers, for different languages or just more funky
          unicode.
        - Support for More common layouts like Colemak, Qwertz, Azerty, on
          the _DDL layer.
  
        These could be #defines in the configuration block for the user,
        and cut out/in the relevant code. To offer something that works
        only as an alternative to QWERTY_DVORAK (such as a QWERTY_AZERTY
        option) is fine.  Almost nobody will use the 'descramble' system
        anyway, and that is a lot of tedious work to remap. It will be
        nice if a layout follows the common version of that layout as
        closely as possible. The _LTR/_DDL and _NSY/_DDN layers have the
        same status, they should both work perfectly with everything.

        Writer of this (Jos B,) will probably not do this, but if someone likes 
        to contribute something, that should work.
