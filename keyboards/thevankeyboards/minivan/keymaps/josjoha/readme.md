# Dvorak on the Minivan

This is a Dvorak layout for the Minivan 40% keyboard, default hardware
configuration (44 keys).

This keymap.c was edited from the default provided with this version of
QMK on Github, and the LED support was copied from ../jetpacktuxedo/
keymap. This has a breathing effect on the third LED. The other LEDs
where set to indicate the active layer.
