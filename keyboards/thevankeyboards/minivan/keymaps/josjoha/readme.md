# Dvorak on the Minivan

This is a Dvorak layout for the Minivan 40% keyboard, default hardware
configuration (44 keys).

This keymap.c was edited from the default provided with this version of
QMK on Github, and the LED support was copied from ../jetpacktuxedo/
keymap. By Jos B., <joshb@xs4all.nl>


    - Basic layers are: * letters (normal Dvorak layout), (Led: off)
                        * numbers with remaining symbols, (Led: blue)
                        * function keys,                  (Led: red)
                        * and a movement layer            (Led: green)
      Extra layers: * keys like Print-Screen, CapsLock,   (Led: purple)
                    * navigation and numbers other hand,  (Led: green/blue)
                    * special characters like √©.          (Led: cyan)

    - Upper left key always goes back to default layer, then is Escape.

    - All layers can be statically active by toggling to the function
      layer, and then to the desired layer (top row left side).

    - Shift/Alt/Control, Del/Esc and Alt with tap arrows, repeat on
      layers.

      Except ... the Right Control on the base layer is taken off,
      because of tap delay. Right Alt on the base layer is taken off,
      instead it switches to a symbols layer (a bit like a private subset
      of AltGr symbols). (QMK allows one to press-hold to the numerical 
      layer, press a right modifier, release numerical layer, and access
      the base layer with that modifier; so it is still possible, just
      not needed.)
 
    - Leds: breathing effect on the middle LED, other indicate layer.

    Layer 1: Numbers and symbols.

             The numbers are on one hand, to prevent layer hold key
             swapping when typing a longer number, and to be able to
             type without holding a layer key down with the same hand.
             They follow the standard fingers 1-5, and then stay on the
             same hand, but repeat the traditional fingers for each.

             Tilde ~ does not work there without Shift, because of
             some limitation with Shift on tap keys. This part is for
             compatibility with the Pok3r keyboard, where the right hand
             second row keys are not programmable (MWVZ). Hence they
             are programmed with superfluous symbols.

              The right side works with left held modifiers. The left side has
              F-keys with Control+Alt pressed, for switching virtual consoles.

            AltGr or Compose did not seem to work for me, I rather not have
            dead keys. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input 
            With tap-dances this could work ok for quite a few accented letters,
            but only basic codes supported at time of this writing).
