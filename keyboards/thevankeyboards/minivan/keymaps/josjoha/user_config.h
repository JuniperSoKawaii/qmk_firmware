       /*                         Letters / Numbers & Symbols layouts
        *
        * Here you can configure what letters layer (BASE layer), and number&symbols layer you
        * want. This is a dual layout system, so you can choose a second pair as well. You can
        * switch between them with a key on the _RAR layer. All the other layers are the same,
        * regardless of your choice in letter/number&symbol layers.
        *
        * The letters layer is the BASE layer, from which you also reach all other layers.
        * The letters it has is the alphabet in its simplest form: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
        * The numbers & symbols layer has what you find on any regular keyboard: 123… !@#… []/…
        * The numbers & symbols layer is made to fit the Letters layer, due to small differences
        * between layouts like Qwerty and Dvorak (in this case the symbols ‛-’, ‛/’, ‛?’, and ‛_’).
        *
        * Example: A Qwerty letters layer, with a fitting numbers & symbols layer, as ‛Default’.
        *          A Dvorak letters layer, with a fitting numbers & symbols layer, as ‛Alternate’.
        *
        * You will be asked to configure one layout as ‛Default’ and another as ‛Alternate’.
        *
        * A bases layout may have locally re-defined one or more of the common layers. If you
        * choose two bases layouts who re-define the same common layer locally, you will need
        * to choose either one by commenting out the other.

         * ① Number-pad and F-keys layers are only on a toggle. If you want them accessible on a hold key, you can use

         *
         * ② You can use the right side additional key for quick access to an arrow/navigation cluster (see below).

         * ③ Other uses, such as a delete key and/or a special interface key your system needs.

         *
         * You can create an arrow-cluster with your additional MORE_key2 hardware key.
         * To do this on the BASE layer would hurt standard Dvorak/Qwerty. There might be a ./bases_* option
         * for Qwerty with arrows on the BASE layer.
         * Either way: this new key can toggle to _MOV layer, with the key that on the _MOV layer becomes the down-arrow,
         * in the middle of an arrow cluster in a triangle format. To do that, uncomment MOREKEY2_ARROW_CLUSTER.

         * that much used there, with navigation cluster combinations).
