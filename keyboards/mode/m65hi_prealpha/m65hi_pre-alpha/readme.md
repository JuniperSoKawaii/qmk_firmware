# Mode M65HI (pre-release Alpha version)

This is the firmware page for the pre-Alpha version of the Mode M65HI PCB. It was intended as a test prototype. For the public-released Alpha release, use the `./m65hi_alpha` firmware.

This PCB was not publicly released. Its firmware is kept as an archive for prototyping purposes and future developments.

# Needed patches 
 
For the firmware to properly work, the PCB needs a jumper from the cathode of the right alt key to the exposed pin PA7.
