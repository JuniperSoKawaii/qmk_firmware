Here are the layouts for my keymap.

Layout 0 is a basic 65% layout with some personal additions. I swapped backspace and \ for comfort and am using GRAVE ESC for the combination escape and tilde. I couldn't think of another use for my extra keys on the right so my only Lead command is N A V Y for a wholesome version of the Navy SEALS copypasta.

Layout 1 adds the Function keys and Home key cluster to the number row and side keys. I am not a programmer so these keys don't need to be accessed very often for me.

Layout 2 adds media keys and Print Screen as I couldn't think of anything else to add.
