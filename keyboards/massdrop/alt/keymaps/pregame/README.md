# Massdrop Alt Pregame

This keymap is here to show some love to the MD Alt. This is a stripped down version of the Drop Ctrl Endgame; hence the name Pregame.

## Features

These are the features currently supported by this keymap:

## RGB Can be customized by "NAME OF COLOR" in the Keymap.c file. 
	1. Look at keymap for example.  My base layer the W,A,S,D and Arrow Keys are CHART short for CHARTREUSE (Close to NVIDIA GREEN). The values to pick from are located on keymap.h file.
	2. I have applied static colors to the Function layer that let you know which keys are available to that layer only.  The not lit up keys are still accessible if set to Transparent Keycap!!! 

### Credits

This was all converted originally from the Drop Ctrl Endgame.  I took nblyumberg's version of code and converted it to fit into the alt.
RGB timeout functionality was originally inspired by the code in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/algernon/9182469e21894192017f2bb5d478c7df).
LED config code was mostly transferred from [matthewrobo keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/massdrop/ctrl/keymaps/matthewrobo).


**Rest of the information about RGB matrix, scan matrix, and whatever information I have used was made publicly available by many other awesome members of the community.**
