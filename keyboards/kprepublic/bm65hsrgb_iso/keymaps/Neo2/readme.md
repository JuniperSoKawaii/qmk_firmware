# Neo2 Layout

This is a basic working Neo2 layout for the bm65hsrgb_iso keyboard.

For more information look at:  
[www.neo-layout.org](https://www.neo-layout.org/)  

The most important Layers (NEO1, NEO2, NEO3, NEO4) are 85% working and the Layout is generally useable.  
To use it, simply have your system layout set to QWERTZ, as with the original reNeo software.

There is also a QWERTZ Layout for fallback reasons.  
It's activated by default and the Switching is done via the Fn layer.  
To make Neo2 default, simply switch the layer ID numbers in code.
