# Keymap explanation

I built this keymap to learn a new layout (which is Colemak-DHm), get used to ortholinear keyboards and eventually switch to a split keyboard like Swoop. That's why this layout uses just 36 keys. Heavily inspired by [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) by *manna-harbour*. Every layer has something similiar to [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) but is triggered using combos.

# Compile/Flash

```console
$ qmk compile -kb kprepublic/bm40hsrgb/rev2 -km joaopedropio
$ qmk flash -kb kprepublic/bm40hsrgb/rev2 -km joaopedropio
```
