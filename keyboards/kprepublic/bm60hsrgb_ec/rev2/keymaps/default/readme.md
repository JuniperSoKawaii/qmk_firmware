# Default BM60EC Rev 2 Layout

The default key layout for this keyboard. It's a straighforward configuration, with the only unusual elements being the tilde-Esc, and the use of the rotary encoder. The encoder is currently configured to work as a mouse wheel up/down, and left/right when CTRL is depressed. The secondary layer activated by MO(1) contains largely LED-related fuctions, and the PGUP, PGDOWN, HOME, and END functions on the arrow keys.
