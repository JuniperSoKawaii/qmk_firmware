# Overview

My QMK home. I feel as though I stand on the shoulders of giants, for a lot of my code here is borrowed and adapted from so many contributors here (namely Drashna and Konstantin), and that I hope my code here can help or inspire others.

## Layers, Keycodes, and Handlers
### Layers

I have predefined layer names for keyboards:
* **_BASE**: Default Layer
* **_FN**: Function Layer for 60% and above
* **_LOWER** and **_RAISE**: Function layers for 40%

and macropads:
* **_REEDER**: Shortcuts for [Reeder.app](https://reederapp.com/), my RSS feed reader
* **_MEDIA**: Media controls
* **_NAVI**: Navigation macros, for changing tabs and scrolling
* **_MACRO**: Generic macro keys, meant to be customized per app with [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
