# Overview

My user-space code makes full use of many specialized QMK features and may contain experimental features not yet present in the master branch, so be careful when copy pasting code!  If you do find yourself copying code from my fork and need help, I'm available on Discord at @tominabox1 #2342 or the 40% Discord.
