Why?
====

I'm a new fan of miryoku but cannot get past the muscle memory from using
a Kinesis Advantage2. I wanted miryoku (plus QWERTY) but with the space and
backspace keys swapped. I've linked to miryoku source files wherever I can,
only using custom configuration and a modified
`miryoku_babel/miryoku_layer_alternatives.h` generated from the org
[source](https://github.com/nharward/miryoku_babel/tree/nharward).
