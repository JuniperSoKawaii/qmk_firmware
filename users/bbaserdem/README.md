* Let's Split Eh
* Planck

* **Base**: Base layer.
* **Game**: Brings arrow keys to the main cluster, comfortable for gaming use.
* **Numeric**: Has numericals and symbols.
* **Function**: Media and function keys.
* **Mouse**: Manipulates mouse. Can be locked.
* **Music** Allows playing sounds.

# Functionality
