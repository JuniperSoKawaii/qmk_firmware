# On command line:
#
# make all = Make software.
#
# make clean = Clean out built project files.
#
# make coff = Convert ELF to AVR COFF.
#
# make extcoff = Convert ELF to AVR Extended COFF.
#
# make program = Download the hex file to the device, using avrdude.
#                Please customize the avrdude settings below first!
#
# make debug = Start either simulavr or avarice as specified for debugging, 
#              with avr-gdb or avr-insight as the front end for debugging.
#
# make filename.s = Just compile filename.c into the assembler code only.
#
# make filename.i = Create a preprocessed source file for use in submitting
#                   bug reports to the GCC project.
#
# To rebuild project do "make clean" then "make all".

# Processor frequency.
#   Normally the first thing your program should do is set the clock prescaler,
#   so your program will run at the correct speed.  You should also set this
#   variable to same clock speed.  The _delay_ms() macro uses this, and many
#   examples use this variable to calculate timings.  Do not add a "UL" here.
