# Fixed RGB_DISABLE_AFTER_TIMEOUT to be seconds based & small internals cleanup

[#6480](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6480)

- Changes `RGB_DISABLE_AFTER_TIMEOUT` to be based on milliseconds instead of ticks.
- Includes a code cleanup, resulting in a savings of 100 bytes, depending on features used.
- Fixed issues with timeouts / suspending at the wrong time not turning off all LEDs in some cases.

The `RGB_DISABLE_AFTER_TIMEOUT` definition is now deprecated, and has been superseded by `RGB_DISABLE_TIMEOUT`. To use the new definition, rename `RGB_DISABLE_AFTER_TIMEOUT` to `RGB_DISABLE_TIMEOUT` in your `config.h` file, and multiply the value set by 1200.

Before: `#define RGB_DISABLE_AFTER_TIMEOUT 100`  
After: `#define RGB_DISABLE_TIMEOUT 120000`
