# Python Required In The Build Process

[#9000](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/9000)

This is the last release of QMK that will work without having Python 3.6 (or later) installed. If your environment is not fully setup you will get a warning instructing you to set it up.

After the next breaking change you will not be able to build if `bin/qmk hello` does not work.
