# Fix ChibiOS timer overflow for 16-bit SysTick devices

* On 16-bit SysTick devices, the timer subsystem in QMK was incorrectly dealing with overflow.
    * When running at a 100000 SysTick frequency (possible on 16-bit devices, but uncommon), this overflow would occur after 0.65 seconds.
* Timers are now correctly handling this overflow case and timing should now be correct on ChibiOS/ARM.
