* Remove `KC_BRK` alias in favor of `KC_PAUS`
    * `KC_BRK` was a somewhat misleading alias for `KC_PAUSE`, usually used when the intent was to use `KC_PAUS`, or to send a Break scancode, which it doesn't do (Break is Ctrl+Pause on most systems)
    * It has been removed and all its uses replaced with the more common `KC_PAUS` alias
    * Around 25 keymaps (mostly default ones, but also some user keymaps) have been modified as a result
    * This removal opens the door to proper Break and SysRq keycodes being added in future versions of QMK
